## 📌 Executive Narrative

The Queensland water sector this week is dominated by the final consultation push for the **SEQ Agriculture Regional Water Assessment** (closing December 12), with the Department of Local Government, Water and Volunteers (DLGWV) actively soliciting farmer feedback on five core options, including increased use of recycled water and new allocations from Sunwater's Maroon Dam. This strategic planning is occurring against a backdrop of operational vigilance, with **Toowoomba Regional Council** issuing fresh updates on water quality and maintaining low-level restrictions as summer approaches.

Politically, the focus is shifting to the intersection of water and energy costs. The **Queensland Farmers' Federation (QFF)** has escalated its advocacy on affordable electricity for irrigators, following a recent delegation to St George and ahead of tomorrow's National Agriculture Day breakfast with **Premier David Crisafulli**. Meanwhile, the **Paradise Dam** replacement project continues to advance under the new government's "Early Works" mandates, with recent fact sheets reinforcing the necessity of a full rebuild due to long-term concrete strength issues, a narrative strongly supported by the current administration to contrast with previous delays.

## 🧭 Ongoing Issues Summary (Last month)

**[Paradise Dam Rebuild & Early Works]**

- **Status:** **Active / Construction Preparation.**
- **Update:** Following the mid-2025 "green light" from the Crisafulli Government, Sunwater has released new fact sheets (Oct 2025) detailing the technical basis for the full rebuild (concrete swelling and carbonation issues).
- **Context:** Road upgrades ($11M package) leading to the dam site were marked as complete in late October, enabling heavy vehicle access for the main wall construction. The government continues to frame this as "fixing the previous administration's failure."
- **Opposition/Criticism:** While the rebuild is welcomed, **Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers** and local irrigators remain critical of the timeline, emphasizing that water security "uncertainty" persists until the new wall is fully operational (expected late 2020s).

**[Burdekin Falls Dam Raising]**

- **Status:** **Planning & Enabling Works.**
- **Update:** Work continues on the 2-metre raising project. Recent budgetary confirmations (State Budget 2024-25) allocated $540 million to the project.
- **Dissent:** Environmental groups remain opposed to the raising due to potential sediment impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.
- **Sunwater Role:** Sunwater is currently managing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and conducting geotechnical works at the saddle dams.

**[Reef Protection Regulations]**

- **Status:** **Stakeholder Conflict.**
- **Update:** The **Bundaberg Ag-Food & Fibre Alliance (BAFFA)** has issued a submission (Aug/Sept 2025) heavily criticizing the statutory review of Reef protection standards.
- **Core Conflict:** BAFFA argues the current regulatory framework is "fundamentally unsuitable" for the region's diverse, multi-crop farming systems, creating administrative burdens that do not align with on-farm realities.
