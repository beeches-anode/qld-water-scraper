## Template Usage Guidelines

1. **Complete All Sections:** Every section should be addressed, even if the information is limited. Use "Not available" or "Under assessment" where appropriate.

2. **Be Specific:** Include concrete details, dates, numbers, and specific sources rather than vague statements.

3. **Maintain Objectivity:** Present information factually, including both positive and negative aspects, claims and concerns.

4. **Cite Sources:** Reference specific documents, reports, or announcements throughout the document.

5. **Update Regularly:** Keep the document current as the project progresses, updating the `lastUpdated` date in the front matter.

6. **Consistent Formatting:** Use the same heading structure, bullet point style, and formatting conventions across all project documents.

7. **Subheadings:** While main headings are fixed, subheadings under "Project History and Status" and other sections can be customized based on the specific project's needs.
