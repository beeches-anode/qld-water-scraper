# Strategic Market Analysis: Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme (BWSS)

## Market Dynamics, Pricing Architecture, and Volumetric Utilization Trends 2024--2029

### 1. Executive Strategic Assessment

The Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme (BWSS) represents a complex, bifurcated market currently operating under a unique set of hydrologic, structural, and economic pressures. As of the 2024--2025 water year, the scheme is defined by a distinct divergence between short-term liquidity and long-term asset security. The market is undergoing a fundamental structural transition, driven primarily by the rapid conversion of agricultural land from sugarcane--a broadacre, drought-tolerant crop--to high-value perennial horticulture, specifically macadamia orchards. This shift is altering the inelasticity of water demand, raising the floor price for permanent entitlements while simultaneously creating temporary surpluses during wet years due to high announced allocations.

Current market valuations indicate a "two-speed" economy. The permanent entitlement market is trading at historical highs, with Medium Priority (MP) allocations commanding prices in the range of $3,500 to $4,000 per megalitre (ML).<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup> This valuation reflects a scarcity premium driven by the uncertainty surrounding the Paradise Dam rebuild and the capital intensity of the macadamia expansion. Conversely, the temporary (seasonal assignment) market is depressed, with trades frequently executing between $0/ML and $60/ML.<sup>[[3](#ref3)]</sup> This pricing disconnect is a function of immediate hydrologic abundance--with Sunwater announcing 100% allocations for 2024/25 and 2025/26<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>--clashing with long-term structural anxiety regarding future reliability.

A critical, often misunderstood component of this market is the "Peak" versus "Off-Peak" distinction. This product differentiation does not apply to all water but is a legacy of the integration of Paradise Dam (Burnett Water Pty Ltd) entitlements into the existing Sunwater distribution network. The differential pricing mechanisms for these products act as a capacity management tool, influencing on-farm infrastructure investment and operational timing for irrigators.<sup>[[6](#ref6)]</sup>

This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of these dynamics. It dissects the pricing structures set by the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA), evaluates the volumetric holdings typical of the region's diverse agricultural base, and assesses the future outlook for water trading as the region navigates the Paradise Dam improvement projects.

### 2. Institutional Framework and Market Architecture

To accurately interpret pricing signals in Bundaberg, market participants must first understand the hybrid institutional framework that governs the scheme. The BWSS is not a monolithic entity; it is an amalgamation of legacy infrastructure and newer capacity augmentations, each governed by distinct legal instruments and pricing methodologies.

#### 2.1 The Two-Tier Entitlement System: Sunwater vs. Burnett Water

The most significant structural feature of the Bundaberg market is the distinction between "Old Water" and "New Water." This bifurcation impacts trading rules, pricing components, and delivery security.

Sunwater Allocations ("Old Water"):

These entitlements represent the original capacity of the scheme prior to the construction of Paradise Dam in 2005. They are associated with the Fred Haigh Dam and the original river/channel distribution network.

- Regulatory Status: Prices for these entitlements are strictly regulated by the QCA under the Rural Irrigation Price Review process.<sup>[[8](#ref8)]</sup> The QCA sets the maximum allowable revenue Sunwater can recover for efficient costs.
- Delivery Rights: Historically, these allocations carried implicit rights to delivery capacity within the channel system. "Old Water" holders typically pay the standard regulated Part A, B, C, and D tariffs without additional capacity surcharges.

Burnett Water Allocations ("New Water"):

These entitlements were created via the construction of Paradise Dam and Kirar Weir. They are held legally by Burnett Water Pty Ltd (BWPL), a subsidiary of Sunwater.<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>

- Contractual Status: While physically delivered through the same river and channel network, "New Water" is sold under commercial contracts. The pricing for these entitlements was originally established through a tender process (e.g., the $550/ML shelf price in 2018<sup>[[10](#ref10)]</sup>) and includes specific provisions regarding channel access.
- The Peak/Off-Peak Mechanism: Because the existing channel network had finite flow capacity, BWPL allocations distributed via channels were sold with "Flow Rate Entitlements." This necessitated the creation of Peak and Off-Peak products to manage congestion during high-demand summer months. New allocations often entail an additional "Capital Charge" to account for the marginal impact on infrastructure capacity.<sup>[[6](#ref6)]</sup>

#### 2.2 Priority Group Classifications

Water reliability in the scheme is managed through a priority system, which dictates the announced allocation percentage (AA) available to growers at the start of the water year.

| Priority Group       | Target Reliability          | Primary Use Case                                                         | Market Implication                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High Priority (HP)   | > 95% monthly reliability   | Urban (Bundaberg Regional Council), Industrial, High-Value Horticulture. | Commands a massive premium. HP water is rarely traded on the open market and is usually held by Council or industry majors to drought-proof operations.<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>                                             |
| Medium Priority (MP) | ~80-90% monthly reliability | Broadacre irrigation (Sugarcane, Avocados, Macadamias).                  | The primary liquidity pool. Subject to seasonal fluctuation. While currently at 100% allocation<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>, historical lows (e.g., <20%) drive the need for large volumetric holdings to buffer drought years. |

#### 2.3 The Zoning System

The scheme is geographically divided into River and Channel zones. Pricing and trading rules differ significantly between these zones due to the costs associated with the distribution network (pumps, channels, pipes).

- River Zones (e.g., Burnett Zones CA, CB): Users pump directly from the river. They pay Bulk Water charges (Part A/B) but avoid the expensive Distribution charges (Part C/D).
- Channel Zones (e.g., Kolan, Isis, Woongarra, Gooburrum): Users are supplied via Sunwater’s intricate network of channels and pipelines. These zones face the highest costs due to electricity requirements for pumping.<sup>[[11](#ref11)]</sup> Trading from a River zone to a Channel zone is often restricted by physical capacity, whereas trading out of a Channel zone attracts significant Termination Fees.<sup>[[12](#ref12)]</sup>

### 3. The Paradise Dam Crisis: Market Disruption and Structural Scarcity

The valuation of water in Bundaberg cannot be analyzed without addressing the defining structural event of the last decade: the safety-driven lowering of the Paradise Dam wall. This event fundamentally altered the supply-demand balance and introduced a risk premium into permanent water prices.

#### 3.1 The Infrastructure Failure and Capacity Reduction

Paradise Dam, commissioned in 2005, added approximately 124,000 ML of Medium Priority and 20,000 ML of High Priority water to the region.<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup> However, following the 2013 floods, structural concerns regarding the dam's stability led to a decision in 2019/2020 to lower the spillway by 5.8 meters.<sup>[[13](#ref13)]</sup>

- Volume Impact: This reduction significantly curtailed the storage capacity, effectively removing a substantial buffer from the system. While current rainfall has masked this deficit, the potential yield of the scheme was structurally reduced.
- Market Reaction: The immediate market response was a freeze in investment confidence followed by a surge in demand for remaining secure water. The risk of lower future allocations forced growers, particularly those with permanent tree crops, to acquire "insurance water"--holding excess entitlements to ensure survival during dry years when the reduced dam capacity would fail to support 100% allocations.<sup>[[14](#ref14)]</sup>

#### 3.2 Economic Impact and the "Scarcity Premium"

The economic reverberations of the dam lowering were quantified in several impact assessments. An analysis by Adept Economics and others estimated that a permanent reduction in capacity could cost the region billions in Gross Regional Product (GRP) over a 30-year horizon.<sup>[[15](#ref15)]</sup>

- The Rebuild Commitment: In late 2024 and 2025, the Queensland Government (both the former Labor administration and the current Crisafulli LNP Government) recommitted to the full reinstatement of the dam wall.<sup>[[17](#ref17)]</sup>
- Current Sentiment: Despite the commitment, the timeline for the rebuild introduces a 5-10 year window of vulnerability. This "interim scarcity" appears to be a significant driver of the current $3,500/ML valuation for MP water. Investors appear to be pricing in the risk of the construction phase, not just the eventual restored capacity.<sup>[[18](#ref18)]</sup>

#### 3.3 Hydrologic Context for 2024/2025

Contrasting the structural anxiety is the immediate hydrologic reality. The 2024 and 2025 water years to date have seen above-average rainfall and widespread flooding across eastern Queensland. The Bureau of Meteorology has maintained a 'La Niña Watch' for much of 2024, with ENSO conditions technically neutral but rainfall patterns more akin to a wet phase.<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup><sup>[[19](#ref19)]</sup>

- Announced Allocations: Sunwater has announced 100% allocations for both High and Medium Priority users in the Burnett and Kolan sub-schemes for the 2025/2026 water year.<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>
- Storage Levels: As of late 2025, storage compartments remain healthy, suppressing the immediate need for spot-market water and crashing temporary prices, even as permanent prices remain high due to the long-term structural outlook.<sup>[[19](#ref19)]</sup>

---

### 4. Permanent Allocation Trading: Prices and Valuation

The market for permanent water entitlements (Water Access Entitlements or WAE) in Bundaberg is robust, transparent, and currently favoring sellers. The transition to horticulture has created a floor price, below which few entitlement holders are willing to sell.

#### 4.1 Current Pricing Benchmarks (2024--2025)

Analysis of the Queensland Government Water Trading Register and broker reports reveals a clear appreciation in asset values.

Medium Priority (MP) Pricing:

- Weighted Average Price: The DLGWV 'Permanent Water Trading Interim Report' (as at February 2025) reports a weighted average price of approximately $3,478 per ML for Medium Priority water in the Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme.<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup>
- Broker Listings: Active sell orders on platforms like Ruralco and Waterfind show asking prices ranging from $3,500/ML to $4,000/ML.<sup>[[2](#ref2)]</sup><sup>[[37](#ref37)]</sup> This represents a significant capital appreciation from the ~$550/ML tender prices seen in 2018 for Burnett Water allocations.<sup>[[10](#ref10)]</sup>
- High Priority (HP) Pricing: Trading in HP water is extremely thin due to tight holding by urban utilities. Limited transaction evidence and broker guidance suggest HP entitlements are valued significantly higher than MP entitlements, often in the mid-$5,000s/ML and above, though available data points are sparse and values are highly deal-specific.<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>

Table 1: Permanent Water Entitlement Pricing Snapshot (2024-2025)

| Priority Group  | Zone Type                | Estimated Price Range ($/ML) | Trend         |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Medium Priority | River (Burnett/Kolan)    | $3,200 -- $3,800             | Stable/Rising |
| Medium Priority | Channel (Isis/Woongarra) | $3,500 -- $4,200             | Rising        |
| High Priority   | River/Channel            | $5,500+ (Est.)               | Illiquid      |

Source derived from.<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup> Note that Channel water often appears "cheaper" on a face-value basis if the buyer must also assume high fixed Part C charges, but the scarcity of channel capacity often drives the price up.

#### 4.2 Termination Fees and the Channel-River Spread

A critical pricing dynamic is the cost of moving water out of the Sunwater distribution network. If a channel irrigator wishes to sell their water to a river user (or simply cease paying the high Part C/D infrastructure charges), they must pay a Termination Fee.

- Mechanism: The Termination Fee is calculated as a multiple (typically 11x) of the fixed access charge (Part C) to compensate Sunwater for the stranded asset risk.
- 2024/2025 Fees: The fee to terminate a delivery entitlement in the Bundaberg Channel is approximately $832.72/ML to $983.07/ML.<sup>[[12](#ref12)]</sup>
- Market Impact: This fee creates a "soft ceiling" on the price spread between River and Channel water. A River buyer will not pay more for Channel water than the cost of River water plus the termination fee. Conversely, Channel sellers are reluctant to sell below the River price minus the termination fee.

#### 4.3 Key Drivers of Valuation

1. Horticultural Conversion: The Bundaberg region is now the second-largest macadamia producing region in Australia, with over 7,800 hectares under orchard.<sup>[[22](#ref22)]</sup> Macadamia trees are permanent capital assets with a productive life of 40+ years. Unlike sugarcane, which can be fallowed, macadamia trees die without water. This inelastic demand forces growers to secure permanent water as a primary capital input, effectively capitalizing the water value into the land value.
2. Land Values: High-quality horticultural land in Bundaberg with secure water access is attracting global interest, with large aggregations (e.g., the 1,512ha Winfield and Miara orchards) hitting the market.<sup>[[24](#ref24)]</sup> Institutional investors (pension funds, etc.) value water security highly, supporting high WAE prices.
3. The "Sleeper" Effect: Many cane farms hold more allocation than they currently use (due to profitability constraints). However, rather than selling this "sleeper" water, they are holding it as a hedge against future drought or selling it annually on the temporary market to offset fixed costs. This restricts the supply of permanent water available for sale, tightening the market.<sup>[[25](#ref25)]</sup>

---

### 5. Seasonal (Temporary) Water Markets

In stark contrast to the bullish permanent market, the temporary water market (seasonal assignment) is currently experiencing a period of oversupply and depressed pricing.

#### 5.1 Current Trading Prices and Volumes

For the 2024-2025 water year, the temporary market is characterized by high liquidity but very low clearing prices.

- Price Range: Commercial trades are executing in the range of $10/ML to $60/ML.<sup>[[3](#ref3)]</sup>
- Zero-Dollar Trades: A substantial volume of seasonal assignments are recorded at $0/ML. These transactions typically represent:
- Related Party Transfers: Farmers moving water between different entities or properties they own (e.g., from a river block to a channel block).
- "Gifts": Neighbors or family members assigning unused water to avoid it being "lost" at the end of the water year.<sup>[[4](#ref4)]</sup>
- Representative Trades:
- Bundaberg Zone AD: 100 ML traded at $60/ML.<sup>[[3](#ref3)]</sup>
- Mary Valley (Proxy for region): Trades at $20/ML and $3.33/ML.<sup>[[4](#ref4)]</sup>

#### 5.2 Hydrologic Drivers of Low Prices

The collapse in temporary pricing is a direct function of the rainfall and allocation announcements.

1. 100% Allocations: With full allocations announced<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>, no grower is short of their base entitlement. There is no desperate buying to keep trees alive.
2. Soil Moisture: Recent rainfall events<sup>[[26](#ref26)]</sup> reduce the irrigation deficit. When soil moisture is high, pumps are turned off, and the immediate demand for "wet water" evaporates.
3. The "Part A" Trap: Irrigators must pay the fixed Part A charge (approx. $13.13/ML) regardless of usage.<sup>[[18](#ref18)]</sup> In a year of surplus, an irrigator holding unused water is motivated to sell it at any price--even $5/ML--to recoup a fraction of their fixed costs. This race to the bottom drives temporary prices well below the cost of production.

#### 5.3 Seasonality of Trading

Temporary pricing is highly seasonal. Prices typically peak in the dry spring/early summer months (September--December) when cane is establishing and nut set is occurring. They tend to crash in late summer (January--March) if the wet season arrives as predicted. Current listings show a market anticipating a wet finish to the year, keeping prices soft.<sup>[[19](#ref19)]</sup>

---

### 6. Product Differentiation: Peak vs. Off-Peak Water

A unique and often confusing aspect of the Bundaberg scheme is the distinction between "Peak" and "Off-Peak" water. This is not a universal characteristic of all allocations but a specific contractual mechanism attached to "New Water" (Burnett Water) entitlements delivered through the Sunwater channel network.

#### 6.1 The Physical Capacity Constraint

When Paradise Dam was integrated into the existing Bundaberg scheme, a physical challenge arose. The existing distribution channels (e.g., the Woongarra and Isis channels) were designed to service the original "Old Water" allocations. They had limited spare hydraulic capacity.<sup>[[6](#ref6)]</sup>

- The 15% Rule: Engineering studies indicated that the channel systems generally had about 15% spare capacity (5% in Woongarra).<sup>[[6](#ref6)]</sup>
- Product Segmentation: To sell the "New Water" without upgrading the channels (which would have been prohibitively expensive), Burnett Water sold allocations with restricted flow rights.

#### 6.2 The Dual Product Structure

- Peak Allocation: This premium product grants the holder the right to pump water during peak demand periods (typically 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM or during high-demand summer months). It utilizes the limited spare capacity of the channel.
- Off-Peak Allocation: This discounted product restricts the holder to taking water during off-peak times (e.g., nights or weekends) or when system demand is low. To utilize this water effectively, a grower typically requires significant on-farm storage (ring tanks) to harvest water at night for daytime irrigation.<sup>[[27](#ref27)]</sup>

#### 6.3 Pricing Differentials and Capital Charges

The market value of these products is differentiated by the Capital Charge (Part C equivalent) levied on them. This charge is specific to the zone and reflects the marginal cost of capacity.

Table 2: Indicative Peak vs. Off-Peak Capital Charges (Burnett Water, circa 2021-22)<sup>[[7](#ref7)]</sup>

| Distribution System | 'Peak' Capital Charge ($/ML) | 'Off-Peak' Capital Charge ($/ML) | Economic Signal                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isis                | ~$21.16                      | ~$6.16                           | Strong incentive to choose Off-Peak if on-farm storage exists.                         |
| Abbotsford          | ~$33.79                      | ~$18.79                          | Peak water is significantly more expensive.                                            |
| Gin Gin / Bingera   | ~$9.51                       | ~$0.00                           | Off-Peak attracts zero capital charge, making it highly attractive for flexible users. |
| Woongarra           | ~$5.97                       | ~$0.00                           | Minimal cost for Off-Peak access.                                                      |

Note: These charges are in addition to the standard river and distribution usage charges. The zero-dollar charge for Off-Peak in some zones reflects that night-time usage imposes negligible stress on the channel infrastructure. Subsequent fee schedules for 2023-24 and 2024-25 show higher absolute levels (Peak charges up to ~$38-40/ML and Off-Peak up to ~$21/ML in some zones), but the relative differentials between zones and between Peak and Off-Peak remain similar.<sup>[[28](#ref28)]</sup>

#### 6.4 Operational Implications

For an irrigator, the choice between Peak and Off-Peak is an optimization problem:

- Peak Water: Higher annual fixed cost, but lower capital requirement (direct irrigation from the channel).
- Off-Peak Water: Lower annual fixed cost, but high capital requirement (construction of on-farm dams and high-capacity lift pumps to harvest water quickly during the off-peak window).
- Trading Impact: Peak water entitlements generally trade at a higher face value on the permanent market due to their operational flexibility. Off-Peak entitlements are harder to sell as they require a buyer with specific on-farm infrastructure.<sup>[[27](#ref27)]</sup>

---

### 7. Volumetrics, Agronomy, and Utilization

To understand demand in Bundaberg, one must analyze the typical volumetric profiles of the region's agricultural enterprises. The market is driven by two very different business models: the traditional sugarcane farm and the modern macadamia orchard.

#### 7.1 Farm Size and Volumetric Holdings

The Sugarcane Model:

- Average Farm Size: The average cane farm in Queensland is approximately 77 hectares.<sup>[[29](#ref29)]</sup>
- Water Requirement: Sugarcane in Bundaberg typically has a crop water requirement of 4--6 ML/ha for full production. However, due to the lower gross margin of sugar, many farmers practice "supplementary irrigation," applying less than the optimal amount.
- Typical Holding: A typical cane enterprise might hold 300 ML to 500 ML of MP allocation.
- Economic Pressure: Audit data of a 46ha cane farm shows irrigation energy costs (pumping) of ~$20,000 per annum for just 160mm (1.6 ML/ha) of application.<sup>[[30](#ref30)]</sup> This high marginal cost discourages full utilization of allocations, leading to "sleeper" water.

The Macadamia Model:

- Average Farm Size: Macadamia orchards in Bundaberg are characterized by consolidation. The average orchard size is over 100 hectares<sup>[[23](#ref23)]</sup>, with major aggregations exceeding 700 hectares.<sup>[[24](#ref24)]</sup>
- Water Requirement: Macadamias are thirsty, requiring 8--12 ML/ha in peak production, though highly efficient micro-irrigation can reduce this to 5--6 ML/ha.<sup>[[31](#ref31)]</sup>
- Typical Holding: A commercial orchard will typically hold 500 ML to 1,500 ML of allocation, often a mix of MP (for bulk volume) and HP (for survival assurance).
- Utilization: Unlike cane, macadamia growers utilize a higher percentage of their allocation because water stress directly impacts nut quality and yield. They are less sensitive to pumping costs due to the higher value per hectare of the crop.

#### 7.2 Utilization Rates and "Sleeper" Water

A persistent feature of the BWSS is the under-utilization of total scheme entitlement.

- Utilization Factor: Sunwater and QCA data indicate that annual deliveries to Bundaberg channel customers are materially below total distribution entitlements, implying significant under-utilization of allocated water. Indicative figures for recent years show deliveries well under the full entitlement base (on the order of 40-50% utilisation in some seasons), though reported volumes vary depending on whether bulk WSS, distribution entitlements or broader regional water assessment estimates are used as the denominator.<sup>[[11](#ref11)]</sup><sup>[[18](#ref18)]</sup><sup>[[32](#ref32)]</sup><sup>[[34](#ref34)]</sup>
- Implications: This indicative utilisation rate implies a large volume of entitlements that are not used every year ("sleeper" water), particularly on lower-margin cane farms that treat water as a drought buffer rather than a production input. In theory, this water could be traded to the expanding horticultural sector. However, if this water were fully activated by trading it to macadamia growers (who use it every year), the pressure on the channel system's delivery capacity would increase drastically, potentially triggering the "Peak" capacity constraints discussed in Section 6.

#### 7.3 Energy Costs as a Utilization Barrier

For many growers, the cost of moving water (Part D) is a bigger barrier than the cost of owning water (Part A).

- Part D Charges: The variable distribution charge (Part D) is approximately $55-$100/ML across most channel zones in the current QCA price path, with historically higher values in some high-lift sub-systems.<sup>[[34](#ref34)]</sup>
- Audit Findings: Energy audits reveal that many older cane farms have inefficient pumping systems (fixed speed vs. variable speed drives), inflating the cost per ML pumped. Upgrading a 30kW pump to a more efficient system can save ~$8,900/year, but the capital cost ($16,000+) is a barrier.<sup>[[30](#ref30)]</sup> This economic friction keeps utilization rates low in the cane sector.

---

### 8. Regulatory Pricing Framework (2025--2029)

The cost of owning and using water in Bundaberg is set to change under the final pricing path determined by the QCA for the 2025--2029 period.

#### 8.1 The Final Price Path

The QCA has released its final price path decisions that aim to transition prices towards "cost-reflective" levels (lower bound cost recovery).

- Part A (Fixed) Increases: The Part A charge is projected to rise to cover the fixed costs of asset maintenance. For 2025-26, the Part A Bulk charge is recommended to be ~$13.21/ML, rising to ~$14.38/ML by 2028-29.<sup>[[34](#ref34)]</sup>
- Part C (Distribution) Increases: The fixed distribution charge is the most significant cost for channel users.
- Bill Impacts: The QCA estimates annual price increases for Bundaberg Channel customers in the range of 2.5% to 5.3% over the next price path.<sup>[[18](#ref18)]</sup>

#### 8.2 Government Subsidies

Crucially, the Queensland Government continues to intervene to suppress irrigation prices.

- 15% Discount: The government has directed Sunwater to apply a 15% discount to the usage and fixed charges for eligible irrigation customers.<sup>[[35](#ref35)]</sup> This discount softens the blow of the QCA's cost-reflective pricing and is a key variable in farm budgeting.
- Cost Recovery: Despite the discount, cost recovery in the scheme is improving, projected to reach 94% by 2023-24 (and higher in the new path), reducing the taxpayer subsidy required to maintain the assets.<sup>[[36](#ref36)]</sup>

#### 8.3 Future Pricing Tables (QCA Final Price Path 2025-29)<sup>[[34](#ref34)]</sup>

| Year    | Bulk Fixed (Part A) $/ML | Bulk Volumetric (Part B) $/ML | Distribution Volumetric (Part D) $/ML |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 2024-25 | $13.13                   | $1.08                         | ~$54 - $89 (varies by zone)           |
| 2025-26 | $13.21                   | $1.48                         | ~$59 - $91                            |
| 2026-27 | $13.59                   | $1.52                         | ~$63 - $94                            |
| 2027-28 | $13.97                   | $1.57                         | ~$67 - $97                            |
| 2028-29 | $14.38                   | $1.61                         | ~$72 - $100                           |

Note: Part D charges vary significantly based on the specific channel system (e.g., Woongarra vs. Isis) due to different energy requirements.

### 9. Conclusion and Strategic Outlook

**Note: This section provides strategic interpretation and forward-looking analysis based on the preceding factual baseline.**

The Bundaberg water market is defined by a disconnect between its hydrologic present (wet, full dams, cheap temporary water) and its structural future (scarce, expensive permanent water, rising regulatory costs).

Based on the factual analysis above, the following strategic implications appear relevant for market participants:

1. **Permanent Acquisition**: The window to acquire lower-priced permanent water appears to have closed. The entry of institutional macadamia investors appears to have established a market floor around $3,500/ML. Any future "New Water" released after the Paradise Dam rebuild will likely be priced near current market rates, not the subsidized tender rates of the past.
2. **Peak vs. Off-Peak Optimization**: Irrigators with on-farm storage capacity may benefit from targeting "Off-Peak" allocations (if available via Burnett Water transfers) or negotiating "Off-Peak" usage profiles. The capital charge differential (e.g., $0 vs ~$21-24/ML in Isis) offers potential annuity savings that could offset the cost of on-farm infrastructure over time.
3. **Utilization vs. Holding**: The "sleeper" water held by the cane sector acts as a latent reserve. As electricity prices (Part D) rise, marginal cane land may become unviable to irrigate. This could trigger a secondary wave of permanent water sales from cane to horticulture, potentially providing liquidity to a tight market.
4. **Regulatory Risk**: While the 15% discount currently protects growers, the underlying QCA cost stack is rising. Growers should budget for annual increases in the range of 2.5% - 5.3% in water costs through 2029, irrespective of usage, due to the rising Part A and Part C fixed charges.

**Interpretation of Current Market Sentiment**: The market appears bullish on asset values but bearish on immediate lease prices. Security of supply--rather than the cost of supply--appears to remain the primary driver for the region's dominant growth industry.
