# **Agent 1 Output: Politics & Parliament**

## **Political Mentions (Last 7 Days)**

*Note: The specific search for "Queensland Parliament Hansard" and direct recent quotes from QLD MPs in the last 7 days yielded limited direct hits in the general search. The following are the most relevant political context items found, with a focus on the broader political climate affecting water policy.*

- **Politician/Party:** **Federal Government / The White House (US Context - False Positive)**
  - **Context:** Presidential Memorandum.
  - **Topic:** *[Note: The search results heavily favored US politics due to the "Presidential Memorandum" and "Senator Elizabeth Warren" results. This indicates a need to tighten the search strictly to "Queensland" and "Australia" for the next run. I have filtered these out for this report to avoid confusion.]*

- **Politician/Party:** **Federal Government (Australia) / DCCEEW**
  - **Context:** Policy Announcement (General Context).
  - **Topic:** Ongoing rollout of "Water Market Reform" and "Murray-Darling Basin" adjustments.
  - **Sentiment:** Neutral/Policy-focused.
  - **Link/Source:** [DCCEEW Water Policy](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/water)

*(Self-Correction: The search tools returned significant US-centric data (California, EPA, Senator Warren). I am manually flagging this as a data quality issue. For the purposes of this report, I will list the lack of specific **Queensland** political "noise" as a finding in itself, or suggest a re-run with stricter geo-fencing if required. Below are the relevant Australian/QLD inferences available.)*

- **Politician/Party:** **Glen Butcher (Minister for Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water)**
  - **Context:** Media Statements (General monitoring).
  - **Topic:** No *major* new water infrastructure announcements in the immediate last 7 days detected in top-level news.
  - **Sentiment:** N/A

- **Politician/Party:** **Deb Frecklington (Shadow Minister for Water)**
  - **Context:** Opposition commentary (General monitoring).
  - **Topic:** Continuing pressure on "Paradise Dam" timelines and "Cost of Living" for farmers.
  - **Sentiment:** Critical.

*Status: No significant **new** parliamentary debates or explosive political media releases specific to QLD water were detected in this sweep. The political cycle appears to be in a quiet period regarding water, or dominated by other issues.*
