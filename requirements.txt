.github/workflows/weekly_scrape.yml   <-- The automation instruction
dashboard.py                          <-- The visual app code
scrape_water_allocations.py           <-- The data gathering engine
qld_water_allocations.csv             <-- The data (generated automatically)

Once `dashboard.py` is in the root and `requirements.txt` is updated, you can go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/), connect your GitHub account, select this repository, and your dashboard will go live!
