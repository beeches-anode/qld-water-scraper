# Unconstructed Bulk Water Infrastructure Projects in Queensland: A Century of Proposals

Queensland's water infrastructure landscape contains **86 significant bulk water projects** proposed between 1925-2025 that were never constructed. These range from iconic schemes like the Bradfield Scheme to contemporary irrigation proposals still under investigation. Every project listed exceeds **$50 million** in 2025 Australian dollars and represents potential future investment opportunities for Queensland's water security.
