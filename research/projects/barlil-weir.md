## Notes on Business Case Status

A comprehensive **Detailed Business Case** for Barlil Weir has not yet been publicly released. However, the project has progressed through the following stages:

- **Phase 1 (2020):** Strategic Business Case completed identifying the Barlil Weir as a feasible priority option through the Options Analysis for Water requirements in the North and South Burnett
- **Phase 2 (2023):** Detailed Business Case identified as a "key short-term action" in the draft Bundaberg Burnett Regional Water Assessment
- **Budget Allocation (2024):** Queensland Government committed $37.7 million for water infrastructure including the Barlil Weir (commissioned target: 2028)

The absence of a publicly available detailed business case reflects the project's ongoing planning and early development stages as of December 2024.
