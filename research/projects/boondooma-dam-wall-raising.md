### Key Finding
The Burnett Water Feasibility Study (completed ~2020) included examination of dam wall raising options but did not recommend raising the Boondooma Dam wall, concluding it would be very expensive without yielding substantial benefits. SunWater was noted as preparing a preliminary business case for long-term water needs of the region, but no formal published business case for dam wall raising has been located.
