# Borumba Dam Raising (Pumped Hydro)

## Overview

A $14.2 billion (as of 2024, estimated up to $18 billion in December 2024 report), 2GW pumped hydro energy storage project at Lake Borumba, approximately 70 km southwest of Noosa in Queensland. The project would increase the dam's storage capacity from 46 to 224 gigalitres and provide approximately 48,000 MWh of large-scale storage to the National Electricity Market. The project targets first power by 2030 and is expected to create approximately 2,300 jobs at peak construction.

## Project Details

**Location:** Lake Borumba, near Imbil, approximately 70 km southwest of Noosa, Queensland (Somerset Region)

**Capacity:** 2,000 MW continuous power output for 24 hours = 48,000 MWh storage capacity

**Key Features:**
- Raising of existing Borumba Dam wall
- Construction of new upper reservoir
- Two-stage development: exploratory works and main works
- Seven dams and two spillways required total
- Underground power station connecting two reservoirs

**Timeline:** Targeting first power in 2030

**Cost:** Originally estimated at $14.2 billion AUD; December 2024 report by Queensland Hydro indicated potential cost blowout to $18 billion

## Governance and Current Status

The project is managed by Queensland Hydro, a publicly owned proprietary company established by the Queensland Government. In June 2025, oversight of Queensland Hydro was transferred to Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC).

**Business Case Status:** A business case for the project was signed off by the state government. As of 2025, Queensland Hydro is developing a refreshed business case and commercial assessment aligned to the Queensland Government's five-year energy roadmap strategy, expected to be completed by mid-2026.

**Strategic Context:** The project is part of the Queensland Government's $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan, which aims to generate 80 percent of the State's energy supply from renewable energy by 2035.

## Feasibility Studies

**SMEC Feasibility Work (2021-2022):**
- SMEC delivered an initial concept study in 2021
- Detailed Analytical Report completed with comprehensive engineering, environmental, geological, hydrological and commercial studies
- Studies confirmed feasibility for further development

**Initial Concept Study:** Identified in the 1980s as having significant potential for pumped hydro due to ideal topography, existing reservoir, and geological stability

**Queensland Government Funding:** $22 million committed (June 2021) for detailed design and cost analysis; $6 billion committed in the 2023-24 budget for project development

## Major Contract Awards (2024)

- Water2Wire Joint Venture (GHD, Mott MacDonald, Stantec): $40 million for dams design and engineering
- AFRY-Aurecon Joint Venture: $39.9 million for pumped hydro energy storage design package
- Decmil: Approximately $111 million to design and construct two temporary workers camps

Total major work packages awarded: Approximately $190 million (2024)

## Research Notes

**Business Case Status:** While a business case for the Borumba Pumped Hydro project was signed off by the Queensland Government, no publicly available PDF of the full business case document was located. The project is currently in the exploratory works phase with a refreshed business case expected to be completed by mid-2026. The most accessible public documentation includes government ministerial statements, Queensland Hydro project pages, and preliminary documentation submitted for regulatory assessment.

**Cost Blowout Context:** A December 2024 Queensland Hydro report (commissioned by the former Labor Government) indicated a potential cost blowout from $14.2 billion to over $18 billion, with less than 1% probability of on-time completion according to project analysis.

**Approvals Pathway:** The project is navigating complex multi-level approvals requiring local, state, and Commonwealth government assessments under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).
