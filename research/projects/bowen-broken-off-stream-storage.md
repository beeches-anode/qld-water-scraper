### Conference Publication - Feasibility Study

**Type:** Conference Proceedings
**Title:** Conjunctive Use of Water Supply Modelling in the Evaluation of Future Performance of a Planned Off-Stream Storage for the North Bowen Coal Basin
**Authors:** S Davidge, A Jha, R Merz
**Publisher:** The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM)
**Conference:** Water in Mining 2006
**Publication Date:** 2006
**Pages:** 225-232
**Document ID:** P200610031
**URL:** https://www.ausimm.com/publications/conference-proceedings/water-in-mining-2006/conjunctive-use-of-water-supply-modelling-in-the-evaluation-of-future-performance-of-a-planned-off-stream-storage-for-the-north-bowen-coal-basin/

**Summary:** This peer-reviewed publication presents the technical evaluation of the planned off-stream storage for the North Bowen Coal Basin. The study addressed water supply reliability concerns following three successive years of below-average rainfall that had left Eungella Dam at critical levels (2003-2004). Using integrated modeling approaches (IQQM and GoldSim), the authors demonstrated how an off-stream storage facility would improve supply reliability for mining operations in the Bowen Basin. The analysis supported the decision to proceed with construction of the new off-stream storage facility.

### Key Findings Summary

No formal standalone business case document for the Bowen Broken Off-Stream Storage project was located. However, the research identified the following key sources:

1. **Primary Technical Reference:** The 2006 AusIMM conference publication by Davidge, Jha, and Merz presents the feasibility analysis and modeling that supported the decision to construct the off-stream storage.

2. **Background Context:** Following the drought of 2003-2004, SunWater conducted comprehensive water supply reliability assessments that led to the off-stream storage being selected as the preferred option over alternatives (dam raising, additional pipelines).

3. **Related Projects:** The "Water for Bowen" project represents a broader regional water infrastructure initiative, with feasibility studies conducted around 2007-2010 and an Environmental Impact Statement prepared.

4. **Implementation Status:** The Bowen Broken Water Supply Scheme is actively managed by Sunwater, with an off-stream storage component (Bowen River off-stream storage with capacity of 5,200 ML) operational as part of the scheme.
