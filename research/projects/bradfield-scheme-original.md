# Bradfield Scheme (Original 1938)

## Overview

Dr John Job Crew Bradfield, the renowned civil engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, proposed an ambitious inter-catchment water diversion scheme in 1938 to address recurring droughts in eastern Australia during the Great Depression. His proposal emerged from severe drought conditions affecting Queensland and broader Australia during the 1930s, compounded by economic hardship and unemployment exceeding 20% by 1932.

## Historical Context

Bradfield submitted his comprehensive report "Queensland: The Conservation and Utilization of Her Water Resources" to the Queensland Government in March 1938. The proposal aimed to divert water from coastal northern Queensland rivers across the Great Dividing Range to inland river systems, potentially irrigating central and western Queensland and sections of South Australia. Bradfield framed the scheme as a large-scale public works project capable of employing tens of thousands while transforming arid interior regions into productive farmland.

## Original Proposal Details

### Water Sources and Diversion Path

The scheme proposed diverting water from three major Queensland rivers fed by monsoon rainfall:

- **Tully River**: Primary source for initial diversion
- **Herbert River**: Secondary source, receiving water from the Tully
- **Burdekin River**: Central component of the scheme

The water would be diverted westward across the Great Dividing Range to replenish inland river systems:

- **Flinders River**: Major inland recipient
- **Thomson River**: Secondary inland recipient
- **Torrens Creek**: Additional inland watercourse
- **Great Artesian Basin**: Proposed aquifer recharge target

### Engineering Components

The scheme required substantial infrastructure:

- **Hell's Gates Dam**: Proposed 122-meter (400-foot) high dam on the upper Burdekin River, serving as the centrepiece of the project
- **Gravity-fed tunnel**: 144-kilometre tunnel from Hell's Gates to the Flinders River for water conveyance
- **Additional infrastructure**: Large pipes, tunnels, pumps, and supporting dams throughout the system

### Water Quantity Estimates

Bradfield estimated the scheme could divert approximately 5,360 GL (gigaliters) per year into the Thomson River catchment. He applied an empirical formula assuming 33% water loss to evaporation and seepage, estimating 114 cubic metres per second (4,000 cu ft/s) of water available for the scheme.

## Methodological Limitations

The original proposal contained significant technical limitations:

- **Elevation measurements**: Taken with a barometer carried on horseback during fieldwork, leading to inaccuracies in land heights and calculation errors
- **Streamflow data**: Extremely sparse or absent for many rivers at the time, forcing reliance on limited hydrological data
- **Survey limitations**: Incomplete geographic and hydrological information constrained the proposal's technical accuracy

## Government and Professional Response

### Initial Government Rejection

Queensland Premier William Forgan Smith promptly rejected Bradfield's initial submission, citing the scheme's enormous upfront capital costs as prohibitive during the severe economic constraints of the late 1930s, still recovering from the Great Depression.

### Nimmo's Critical Review (1947)

In 1947, hydraulic engineer William H.R. Nimmo, chief engineer of the Stanley River Works Board, conducted a comprehensive critical review of the Bradfield Scheme. Nimmo's findings were devastating:

**Water Availability Assessment**: Nimmo demonstrated that Bradfield had overestimated water availability by approximately 250% (two and a half times), significantly inflating the scheme's potential water yield.

**Cost Analysis**: Nimmo calculated that the cost of delivering water to the Flinders River alone would be approximately £100 million (roughly AUD $6.9 billion in 2018 dollars). He determined that irrigation water costs would be 25 to 30 times higher than water supplied by contemporary schemes like the Snowy Mountains Scheme in Victoria and New South Wales.

**Engineering Concerns**: Nimmo identified portions of the scheme as potentially physically impossible, though he acknowledged that further surveys would be necessary to definitively determine feasibility constraints.

Bradfield's revised 1941 cost projections of "up to £40 million" (approximately AUD $3.2 billion in 2018 dollars) were dismissed as understated. Nimmo's analysis was widely circulated, including to the Prime Minister's office, where Post-War Reconstruction Minister John Dedman referenced Nimmo's unfavourable findings in correspondence with agricultural organizations.

## Modern Assessments and Contemporary Viability

### CSIRO Investigation (2022)

A comprehensive 2022 CSIRO investigation for the National Water Grid Authority examined the contemporary technical and economic viability of the Bradfield Scheme. Key findings include:

- **Technical feasibility**: While technically possible, the scheme cannot be economically justified
- **Water quantity**: Maximum divertible water was less than half of Bradfield's original estimates
- **Cost recovery**: The cost of diversion infrastructure created such a large premium on water that future crop revenues would never recover the capital investment over the scheme's lifetime, even under unrealistically optimistic economic assumptions
- **Uneconomic water pricing**: The cost to farmers would be prohibitively high compared to alternative water sources

### Queensland Government Panel Assessment (2022)

An independent expert panel established by the Queensland Government recommended against proceeding with the Bradfield Scheme or similar large-scale proposals. The panel identified fundamental issues:

- **Water consistency**: The scheme falters on the primary hurdle of consistent water availability
- **Economic viability**: Unfeasible on economic grounds due to infrastructure costs
- **Environmental impacts**: Significant environmental concerns identified
- **Social and cultural heritage**: Potential negative impacts on Indigenous communities and heritage sites
