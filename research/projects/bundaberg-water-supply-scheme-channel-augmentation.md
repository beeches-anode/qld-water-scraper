### Note on Business Case
The Bundaberg Channel Capacity Upgrade project received $750,000 in Australian Government funding through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF). While a formal public business case document was not located in this research, the project included a detailed feasibility study for channel and pipeline upgrades to increase distribution capacity from Paradise Dam. SunWater was commissioned to undertake a subsequent detailed business case for expanding the irrigation network within the scheme, combining distribution constraint analysis with wider scheme expansion planning. This work is part of the broader Bundaberg and Burnett Regional Water Assessment framework.
