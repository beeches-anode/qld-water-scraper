# Burdekin Falls Dam Raising

## Overview

The Burdekin Falls Dam Raising is a proposed two-metre raising of Queensland's largest dam, located 200 km south of Townsville. The existing dam is the largest in Queensland, with capacity four times that of Sydney Harbour.

## Project Details

**Current Capacity:** 1.8 million megalitres
**Proposed New Capacity:** 2.4 million megalitres (31% increase)
**Additional Storage:** Approximately 574,240 megalitres
**Water Allocations:** 150,000 ML of medium priority water allocations

## Feasibility Study and Business Case

The Australian Government committed $400,000 for the Burdekin Falls Dam Raising Feasibility Study. A comprehensive Feasibility Report (299 pages) was completed in February 2018. This preliminary investigation examined:
- Estimated demand for new water entitlements in the region
- Potential environmental impacts
- Engineering requirements for raising the dam wall

The study findings indicated lower water demand than subsequent discussions with potential customers revealed, suggesting greater demand potential in the short to medium term.

Since 2017, Stantec has been working with Sunwater to support the business case development for the dam safety improvement design and the dam raising project.

## Project Status

- The government approved the dam raising business case
- Sunwater is collaborating with Building Queensland on detailed business case development
- A detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process is underway
- The detailed business case will run concurrently with the EIS to evaluate long-term water demand and determine the extent of raising recommended
- Following EIS approval, Queensland Government will consider an investment decision

## Project Design

The proposed works involve:
- Raising the existing spillway by two metres
- Raising the abutments using concrete buttressing
- Raising and widening the saddle dams
- Constructing a new saddle dam on the right bank

## Strategic Context

The dam raising project is integrated into Sunwater's broader Dam Improvement Program. The improvement works are necessary to satisfy safety requirements and engineering design standards, while the raising provides an opportunity to improve supply reliability concurrently.
