# Burdekin Haughton Channel Capacity Upgrade

## Overview

The Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme Modernisation project represents a major infrastructure investment to upgrade the water distribution system in the Lower Burdekin region. The project includes investigations into channel lining, upgrades, balancing storages, pipeline replacements, and control infrastructure improvements.

### Key Project Details

**Detailed Business Case**: Completed in December 2023 by the National Water Grid Authority, the detailed business case assessed options for modernising the Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme.

**Expected Benefits**:
- Recovery of 15-20 GL of additional water for allocation
- Reduction of groundwater inflows by 2,000-3,000 ML per year
- Improved water security and distribution efficiency

**Infrastructure Components**:
- Channel lining and upgrades
- Balancing storages
- Replacement of existing channels with pipeline infrastructure
- Upgraded control and communication infrastructure
- Haughton main channel upgrade
