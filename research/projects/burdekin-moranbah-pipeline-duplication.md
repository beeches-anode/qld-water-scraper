# Burdekin Moranbah Pipeline Duplication

## Overview

The Burdekin Moranbah Pipeline Duplication refers to potential expansion or duplication of the existing Burdekin to Moranbah water pipeline infrastructure in Queensland. The original Burdekin to Moranbah Pipeline is a 218-kilometre water infrastructure project that transfers water from Burdekin Falls Dam to Moranbah in the Bowen Basin.

## Existing Burdekin to Moranbah Pipeline

### Project Details
- **Length**: 218 kilometres (216-220 km reported in various sources)
- **Cost**: Approximately $270-280 million for the main pipeline component
- **Overall Project Value**: $300 million including associated pipelines and infrastructure
- **Status**: Completed; began operations in April 2007
- **Operator**: SunWater

### Route
The pipeline route begins at Gorge Weir, downstream of the Burdekin Falls Dam, and joins the Enertrade Gas Pipeline route, before cutting east to join the existing Eungella Pipeline to Moranbah.

### Water Capacity
- **Annual Delivery**: 17,000 megalitres (ML) of water per year to the Bowen Basin
- **Expansion Potential**: The infrastructure has capacity to increase by a further 6,000 ML annually

### Infrastructure Components
- Main pump station at Gorge Weir below Burdekin Falls Dam
- Three booster pump stations along the pipeline route
- 600-megalitre storage facility approximately 35km north of Moranbah
- Six-megalitre terminal storage unit at Moranbah

### Associated Pipelines
The overall Moranbah Pipeline Projects include:
- 50km eastern pipeline from Moranbah to Coppabella (commissioned November 2006)
- 70km southern pipeline from Moranbah in the direction of Dysart

### Purpose and End Users
The pipeline transports water to new and existing mines in the northern Bowen Basin, serving as a critical water supply for coal mining operations in the region.

### Funding
Six major mining companies entered into an agreement with SunWater to cover the project costs via water usage charges over a 20-year period:
- BMA Coal
- Macarthur Coal
- Carborough Downs Coal
- Isaac Plains Coal
- Rio Tinto Coal Australia
- Excel Coal

### Construction
- Construction began in late 2005
- Approximately 300 workers were involved in the pipeline construction
- McConnell Dowell achieved an average daily pipe-laying rate of 1.25 km (peaking at 3.1 km)
- Final pipe length completed by December 2006
- Water began flowing through pumping stations by April 2007

## Related Pipeline Projects in the Region

### Haughton Pipeline Duplication Project (HPDP)
A separate pipeline duplication project in the Burdekin region is the Haughton Pipeline Duplication Project, which duplicates portions of the existing Haughton pipeline:
- **Stage One**: Completed in 2020, duplicating 36 kilometres between Ross River Dam and Haughton Channel
- **Stage Two**: Plans for 28 kilometres of new pipeline between Haughton Channel and Burdekin River

### Bowen Pipeline Project
A proposed pipeline project to expand water distribution in the region:
- **Route**: 182 km (116 km main line and 66 km branches) from Burdekin River upstream of Home Hill moving south to Bowen
- **Status**: Proposed project; earlier 2011 investigation was not pursued due to decreased water demand and insufficient financial viability

## Potential Duplication Considerations

While specific business case documents for a dedicated Burdekin Moranbah Pipeline Duplication project were not located, industry sources indicate that:

1. The existing pipeline has capacity for expansion from current 17,000 ML annually to 23,000 ML with infrastructure enhancements
2. Continued industrial demand in the Bowen Basin (particularly coal mining) supports potential infrastructure investment
3. The Haughton Pipeline Duplication Project provides a recent example of pipeline duplication initiatives in the broader Burdekin region
4. Queensland government water infrastructure planning continues to assess regional distribution network enhancements
