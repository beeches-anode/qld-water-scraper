## Research Summary

**Project Location:** Cloncurry River, approximately 20km upstream of Cloncurry, Far North Queensland

**Proposed Capacity:** 248GL (2.1 times the size of Lake Julius)

**Estimated Construction Cost:** Approximately $250 million for zoned earth and rock fill embankment dam

**Project Beneficiaries:**
- Cloncurry Township
- Ernest Henry Mining
- CopperChem Great Australia
- Cudeco Rocklands Group
- MMG Dugald River
- Future agricultural and industrial development

**Background:** The Cave Hill Dam has been discussed as a potential project for over 40 years. Initial business case assessments indicated that costs would likely outweigh benefits at the time of evaluation. The project was funded through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF), with further detailed assessment conducted by MITEZ (Mount Isa to Townsville Economic Zone) using remaining NWIDF funds.

**Current Status:** The project remains on the agenda but has not been prioritized in recent federal funding allocations, including the National Water Grid Fund program.

*Research conducted: 2025-12-02*
