### Key Findings from Research

- **No Detailed Business Case Publicly Available**: As of December 2023, the Detailed Business Case for Gladstone desalination is still in development. No final DBC has been released publicly.
- **Primary Driver**: The desalination project is primarily driven by water requirements for the emerging green hydrogen industry in Gladstone, rather than direct supply to existing alumina/aluminium operations.
- **Related Infrastructure**: The Fitzroy to Gladstone Pipeline (FGP, $983 million) provides an alternative water source but is dependent on rainfall. Desalination would provide climate-independent water supply.
- **Water Scale**: Hydrogen industry estimates suggest need for up to 1 million megalitres of water, requiring large-scale desalination infrastructure.
- **Project Status**: The project is in planning/business case stage as part of the Central Queensland Regional Water Assessment (CQ RWA), funded by $4.5 million from the National Water Grid Fund.
