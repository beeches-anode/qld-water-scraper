# Central Queensland Regional Infrastructure Options

## Overview

*Notes and research to be added.*

## Key Findings

The Central Queensland Regional Infrastructure Options study encompasses a comprehensive regional water assessment funded by the Australian Government through the National Water Grid Fund. The Palaszczuk Government secured $4.5 million from the National Water Grid Fund for the Central Queensland Regional Water Assessment (CQ RWA), with the assessment to be delivered over 2.5 years.

### Assessment Scope
- Examines both infrastructure and non-infrastructure solutions for water supply
- Covers the Fitzroy Basin and surrounding areas
- Focuses on urban centres including Rockhampton, Biloela, and Blackwater
- Aims to improve water security and enable economic growth opportunities

### Related Infrastructure Projects
- **Paranui Weir**: $2 million preliminary business case funding
- **Bedford Weir Raising**: $1.7 million preliminary business case funding
- **Fitzroy to Gladstone Water Pipeline**: $983 million planned investment for regional Queensland

### Water Planning Coordination
The study is driving integration of separate water plans for the Fitzroy Basin, Boyne River Basin, and Calliope River Basin into a single Central Queensland water plan, incorporating adjacent coastal areas into Queensland's water planning framework.
