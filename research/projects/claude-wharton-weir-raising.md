# Claude Wharton Weir Raising

## Overview

Claude Wharton Weir is located on the Burnett River at Gayndah, accessed off the Burnett Highway approximately 3 km northwest of Gayndah. The weir is part of the Upper Burnett water supply scheme, which comprises four storages: Wuruma Dam, John Goleby Weir, Jones Weir, and Claude Wharton Weir. The scheme provides irrigation water for citrus, small crops and dairy farming, as well as urban water supply for the towns of Eidsvold, Mundubbera, and Gayndah.

## Claude Wharton Weir Raising Project

In 2023, the draft Bundaberg Burnett Regional Water Assessment recommended beginning a detailed business case for the raising of the Claude Wharton Weir at Gayndah to supply additional water in the Lower Burnett area. This recommendation was subject to outcomes of the Jones Weir detailed business case and the outcomes of a supply and demand audit.

The assessment was led by Sunwater on behalf of the Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water, and followed months of detailed analysis and consultation with significant input from experts and key stakeholders in the South and North Burnett, Cherbourg and Bundaberg council areas. Independent experts and local stakeholders identified 121 potential initiatives (106 infrastructure and 15 non-infrastructure potential water supply and security options) during the assessment process.

## Weir Management and Recreation

Claude Wharton Weir is owned and managed by Sunwater, while North Burnett Regional Council owns and manages the boat ramp, facilities and recreation areas. The weir joined the Stocked Impoundment Permit Scheme (SIPS) in 2017. In 2017/18, 22,727 golden perch and 18,181 Australian bass were stocked at the weir from SIPS permit sales. The site is popular for both fishing and water sports with no vessel restrictions in place.

## Related Infrastructure Projects

A Gayndah Regional Irrigation Development study was conducted, investigating the feasibility of developing water resources through reinstating the crest level of Claude Wharton Weir, utilising existing water reserves and the transfer of unutilised water allocations.

The Federal Government announced $6.6 million in funding to kick-start feasibility studies for seven major water projects in Queensland. Additionally, Gayndah's water supply infrastructure underwent significant betterment improvements following the 2011 and 2013 disasters, with the upgraded infrastructure remaining functional through four natural disaster events in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
