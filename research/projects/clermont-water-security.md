# Clermont Water Security

## Overview

Clermont Water Security is a Queensland water infrastructure project focused on securing reliable long-term water supply for the town of Clermont and supporting development in the Galilee Basin. The project received a $225,000 commitment from the Australian Government through the National Water Grid Fund for feasibility studies and business case development.

### Key Project Components

- **Primary Water Source**: Theresa Creek Dam (constructed 1983 by Blair Athol Coal), located 22 km southwest of Clermont
- **Scope**: Assessment of new and upgraded major water infrastructure for Clermont, including augmentation and remediation works on Theresa Creek Dam
- **Funding**: $225,000 from the National Water Grid Infrastructure Development Fund (Australian Government) matched by Isaac Regional Council
- **Study Lead**: AECOM Australia Pty Ltd
- **Final Document**: Clermont Sustainable Water Framework - adopted by Isaac Regional Council on January 30, 2018

### Clermont Sustainable Water Framework

The comprehensive framework was developed to:
- Evaluate technical, social, economic and environmental viability of potential new or augmented water infrastructure
- Provide a strategic framework to improve Clermont's aging water supply infrastructure
- Support future economic growth for the region
- Ensure reliable long-term performance of Council's water supply
- Enhance Clermont's resilience to long-term drought, population increases and wet weather events

### Water Security Infrastructure Improvements

- New $2 million, five-megalitre reservoir opened to improve drinking water quality in Clermont
- Total secure water in Clermont network: approximately 10 megalitres
- Minimum three days' supply of clean drinking water stored at any time for emergencies
- $1 million investment in de-silting the raw water offtake structure at Theresa Creek Dam

### Challenges and Infrastructure Concerns

The 2021 comprehensive inspection identified several issues requiring attention:
- Variable gap between left retaining wall and staircase (widening over time)
- Seepage through horizontal and vertical drains
- Cracks in concrete apron slabs
- Siltation concerns in the reservoir
