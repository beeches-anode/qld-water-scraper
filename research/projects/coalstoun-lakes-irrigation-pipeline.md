# Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline

## Overview

The Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline is a proposed water infrastructure project to connect Paradise Dam to the Coalstoun Lakes and Biggenden area in Queensland's North Burnett region. The project aims to unlock irrigation potential in an area with highly fertile volcanic soils that currently relies on seasonal rainfall.

### Project History

- 2019: Federal Government announced $1.5 million in additional funding for feasibility assessment, bringing total North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study funding to $3.5 million
- April 2020: North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study (Strategic Business Case) completed
- 2021: Coalstoun Lakes Water engaged Verterra and KBR to conduct detailed business case study
- October 2022: Detailed business case for Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline completed
- 2023: Project costs increased dramatically from $57 million to $793 million, effectively pricing it out of consideration in the Draft Bundaberg and Burnett Regional Water Assessment

### Current Status

As of 2023-2024, the detailed business case has been completed, but the project has not proceeded to implementation due to significantly increased cost estimates. The Queensland Government's Department of Regional Development noted completion of the detailed business case in their 2023-24 annual report, but the project was left out of further planning under the Bundaberg and Burnett Regional Water Assessment.

### Project Proponent

Coalstoun Lakes Water (CLW) is a not-for-profit community organization run by volunteers that was established to explore bringing water supply to Coalstoun Lakes and surrounding areas following the "Just Add Water" campaign.
