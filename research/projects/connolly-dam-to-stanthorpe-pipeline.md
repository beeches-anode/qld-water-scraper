## Key Findings from Sources

### Project Status
As of 2023-2024, there is no detailed business case publicly available for a direct Connolly Dam to Stanthorpe Pipeline. However, the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment (2023) identified that a Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline "was the only option investigated that fully addresses Stanthorpe's urban water security risk."

### Related Infrastructure
Instead of a direct Connolly Dam to Stanthorpe pipeline, the Queensland Government committed over $300 million to the Toowoomba to Warwick Pipeline project, which will provide drought contingency water supply to Warwick, Allora, Yangan, with water to be carted to Stanthorpe and Killarney during severe droughts. This pipeline is expected to be completed in 2027.

### 2019-2020 Drought Crisis Context
- Water carting from Connolly Dam to Stanthorpe occurred for approximately 18 months (January 2020 - April 2021)
- Cost: $800,000 per month for water carting operations
- 14 trucks delivered up to 42 truckloads daily from Connolly Dam to Storm King Dam
- Additional infrastructure investment of $2.4 million at Storm King Dam
- Total emergency response cost exceeded $13 million
