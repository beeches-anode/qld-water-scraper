# E.A. Leonard's River Diversion Scheme (1887)

## Overview

E.A. Leonard's 1887 river diversion proposal represents one of Australia's earliest recorded concepts for large-scale water transfer from tropical North Queensland to the arid interior. As a geographer, Leonard recommended that the Herbert, Tully, Johnstone, and Barron rivers be "turned around" to irrigate Australia's "dead heart" - a proposal that predated John Bradfield's more famous 1938 scheme by over 50 years.

This early proposal was part of the broader "water dreaming" theme in Australian colonial history, where visions of transforming the inland through massive hydraulic engineering captured the imagination of settlers and planners. Leonard's concept, along with other late 19th-century proposals (such as the 1883 Lake Eyre flooding scheme), laid the conceptual groundwork for later inter-basin water transfer schemes, though none were implemented at the time due to technological limitations and prohibitive costs.

While limited primary documentation about Leonard's specific proposal is readily available in digital archives, the scheme is referenced in contemporary academic literature on Australian water history as a significant early example of the hydraulic ambitions that would characterize much of Australia's 20th-century water policy debate.

## Historical Context

Leonard's 1887 proposal emerged during a period of significant water-related developments in Australia:

- **1883**: South Australian Parliament seriously considered proposals to flood Lake Eyre with seawater via a canal from Upper Spencer Gulf
- **1884**: Victorian Government, facing severe droughts (1877-1884), appointed Alfred Deakin as Chairman of the Royal Commission on Water
- **1887**: The Chaffey brothers began building Australia's first irrigation colonies at Mildura and Renmark on the Murray River; construction of Goulburn Weir commenced (completed 1891), becoming Australia's first major diversion structure for irrigation
- **1887**: J.S. Loughead struck artesian water at Barcaldine, Queensland (December 17), marking a significant moment in Queensland's water history

These developments reflected the growing colonial interest in water management and the broader "hydraulic dreaming" that characterized Australian settlement expansion in the late 19th century.

## Relationship to Later Schemes

Leonard's concept directly influenced or paralleled later, more technically detailed proposals:

- **Bradfield Scheme (1938)**: John Bradfield's proposal to divert the Tully, Herbert, and Burdekin rivers westward over the Great Dividing Range essentially elaborated on Leonard's 1887 vision with specific engineering details
- **New Bradfield Scheme (2019-2020)**: Proposed by Queensland's LNP during the 2020 election, featuring Hells Gates Dam and gravity-fed tunnels
- **Contemporary Assessments**: CSIRO (2020-2021) and Queensland Government expert panel (2022) both assessed Bradfield-type schemes and found them technically feasible but economically and environmentally unviable
