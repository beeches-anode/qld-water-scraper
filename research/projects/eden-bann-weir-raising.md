### Project Status Note

The Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project (LFRIP) was initially conceived as an assessment of raising Eden Bann Weir (Stages 2 & 3) and/or constructing a new Rookwood Weir. Following the Coordinator-General's Evaluation Report (December 2016), which approved the project with conditions, the construction of Rookwood Weir was determined to be the most effective method of gaining the requisite water yield and became the primary focus. **The Eden Bann Weir Stage 2 and Stage 3 raising has not proceeded as a separate project**, with Rookwood Weir construction being prioritized instead.
