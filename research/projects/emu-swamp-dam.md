### Key Research Notes

**Project Status:** The Australian Government cancelled its $162.5 million commitment in 2022-23. The Coordinator-General's evaluation report lapsed on 1 April 2023. Project approvals were transferred to Sunwater on 19 January 2023. The project is now being assessed as part of the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment.

**Cost Escalation:** Original estimate was $84 million (2017), escalated to over $240 million by 2022.

**Funding History:**
- Queensland Government: $13.6 million committed (2019)
- Australian Government (pre-construction): $6 million
- Private irrigators: $23.4 million committed
- Federal Coalition commitment (2022 Budget): $126.5 million (later cancelled)

**No Detailed Business Case publicly available.** Minister Plibersek stated in 2022: "The current feasibility and business case work is insufficient and cost estimates have increased substantially since the initial proposal."
