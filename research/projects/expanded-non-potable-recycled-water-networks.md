# Expanded Non-Potable Recycled Water Networks

## Overview

This project involves expanding non-potable recycled water networks across multiple locations in the Southern Downs and Darling Downs regions of Queensland, including Warwick, Inglewood, Chinchilla, and facilities in the Toowoomba area (including the Wetalla Water Reclamation Facility). The proposal is part of the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment and aims to provide recycled water for use in parks, sporting fields, agriculture, and industrial applications, thereby reducing demand on potable water supplies and improving regional water security.

The Queensland Government has identified opportunities to support local governments to expand these non-potable recycled water networks, subject to the support of relevant local councils. Several projects are already underway or completed in the region, including upgrades to the Warwick recycled water treatment plant and planning for expanded capacity at Wetalla and other facilities.
