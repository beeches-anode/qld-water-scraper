# Gayndah Regional Irrigation Development (GRID)

## Overview

The Gayndah Regional Irrigation Development (GRID) Project is a feasibility study examining opportunities to expand irrigation infrastructure in the Gayndah region to support agricultural growth, particularly for sugarcane production. The project received $1.2 million in funding from the Australian Government through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF).

The study was undertaken by Isis Central Sugar Mill and examines opportunities to enhance sugarcane supply by developing new sugarcane lands and infrastructure in the Gayndah region. The project is closely connected to the broader Bundaberg and Burnett Regional Water Assessment and intersects with the Paradise Dam Improvement Project, which impacts water allocations in the region.

The Gayndah region is part of the Upper Burnett Water Supply Scheme, managed by Sunwater, which supplies water to irrigate approximately 4,450 hectares of land along 165 km of the Burnett River. The scheme provides irrigation water for citrus, small crops and dairy farming, as well as urban water supply for the towns of Eidsvold, Mundubbera and Gayndah.
