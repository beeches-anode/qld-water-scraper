*Research conducted: 2025-12-02*

**Key Findings:**
- No publicly available Detailed Business Case document found (Jacobs prepared one in May 2020 for Etheridge Shire Council, but not published online)
- Project emerged after the failure of the $2 billion IFED project in September 2016
- State government has allocated 390,000 megalitres of water to the project subject to development approvals
- Dam proposed to deliver 130GL per annum (90GL high priority at 95% reliability, 40GL medium priority at 85% reliability)
- Estimated to irrigate 30,000 hectares
- CSIRO studies (2012-2013) provided foundational research showing feasibility
- Queensland Government water releases in 2017 and 2020 have made water progressively available
- Advance Cairns seeking $8 million federal funding for environmental impact study
