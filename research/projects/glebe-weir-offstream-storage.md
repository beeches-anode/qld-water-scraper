### Key Context

**Related Project:** Glebe Weir Raising and Pipeline project (separate from offstream storage) - bankable feasibility study completed, estimated capital cost $300M. This project was being considered as a water supply option for the Wandoan Coal Project.

**Nathan Dam Connection:** The proposed Nathan Dam on the Dawson River would inundate Glebe Weir and its associated infrastructure. Glebe Weir would continue its role in the Dawson Valley Water Supply Scheme until Nathan Dam starts to store water.

**Current Status (as of 2024):** The Glebe Weir Offstream Storage and pipeline option was identified in the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment as requiring detailed assessment, subject to outcomes of the proposed Central Queensland Regional Water Assessment. No Queensland Government funding commitments have been made as of the final RWA publication.
