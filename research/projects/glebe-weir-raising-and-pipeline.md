### Key Findings from Research

**Project Context:**
- The Glebe Weir raising proposal was originally developed as part of the Wandoan Coal Project EIS (approved 2010) to supply water for coal mining operations
- The weir is part of the Dawson Valley Water Supply Scheme, which includes six weirs (Theodore, Orange Creek, Moura, Glebe, Neville Hewitt and Gyranda)
- Since 2015, Glebe Weir has been the discharge point for the Woleebee Creek to Glebe Weir Pipeline (120km), which delivers treated CSG water from QGC's operations

**Current Status:**
- The Wandoan Coal Project received environmental approvals but is currently on hold
- The Glebe Beneficial Use Scheme (GBUS) operates successfully, delivering up to 36,500 ML/year of treated CSG water to the Dawson Valley irrigation scheme
- The Draft Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment (2023) recommends further assessment of a Glebe Weir Offstream Storage and pipeline augmentation
- The Central Queensland Regional Water Assessment (commenced 2024) may include further evaluation of Glebe Weir infrastructure options

**No Detailed Business Case Publicly Available:**
As of December 2, 2025, there is no standalone detailed business case publicly available specifically for the Glebe Weir raising and pipeline project independent of the Wandoan Coal Project EIS documentation.
