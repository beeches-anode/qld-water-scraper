implications: High strategic importance. The $540M Burdekin Falls Dam raising project represents the largest dam expansion investment in Queensland's recent history and provides critical benchmarking data for Sunwater's own infrastructure planning. As Sunwater manages 19 dams across Queensland, this 2-meter raising project demonstrates state government commitment to large-scale water infrastructure investment and sets precedents for Environmental Impact Statement processes, community engagement approaches, and construction timelines (2027 start, April 7, 2027 EIS deadline). The project's scale ($540M for capacity expansion at Queensland's largest dam with 1.86 million ML capacity) offers valuable cost-performance benchmarks. Additionally, community concerns highlighted in the article underscore the importance of stakeholder engagement strategies that Sunwater must consider for any future dam modification projects. The Burdekin catchment represents 7% of Queensland's water resources, making this expansion strategically significant for the state's water security planning.

## Summary

Burdekin Falls Dam, Queensland's largest water storage facility with 1.86 million megalitres capacity, is set for a major expansion following the allocation of $540 million in the 2024-2025 Queensland Budget. The Burdekin Falls Dam Raising Project will increase the dam's capacity by two additional meters, with construction scheduled to begin in 2027.

Located approximately 100 kilometers south of Charters Towers, the dam was completed in 1987 at a cost of $125 million and manages the Burdekin River, which covers about 7% of Queensland's catchment area. The expansion project has generated significant community discussion and represents one of the most substantial water infrastructure investments in Queensland's recent history.

The Coordinator-General has set an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) project declaration deadline of April 7, 2027, establishing a clear timeline for the regulatory approval process. The project aims to enhance water security for North Queensland's agricultural and urban water users while supporting regional economic development.

### Project Details

- **Current Capacity:** 1,860,000 megalitres (Queensland's largest dam)
- **Expansion Investment:** $540 million (2024-2025 QLD Budget)
- **Capacity Increase:** 2-meter raising
- **Construction Start:** 2027
- **EIS Declaration Deadline:** April 7, 2027
- **Original Construction:** Completed 1987 at $125 million cost

### Historical Context

The dam has experienced significant variation in storage levels since completion:
- **Record high:** 221.15% capacity (February 20, 1991)
- **Record low:** 29.83% capacity (November 1987, shortly after completion)

These extremes demonstrate the critical importance of the Burdekin system for managing Queensland's water resources through both flood and drought conditions.

### Regional Significance

The Burdekin Falls Dam serves as North Queensland's primary water security infrastructure, supporting:
- Agricultural irrigation for the Burdekin region
- Urban water supply
- Flood mitigation
- Economic development capacity

The raising project remains a topic of community debate, reflecting the complex balance between water security needs, environmental considerations, and regional development priorities. The substantial state government investment underscores the project's strategic importance to Queensland's long-term water planning.
