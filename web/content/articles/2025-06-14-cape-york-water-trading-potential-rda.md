implications: Indirect policy and competitive implications for Sunwater. The advocacy for water trading mechanisms in Far North Queensland and the Mitchell catchment represents potential precedent-setting policy that could influence water allocation and trading frameworks across Sunwater's operational areas. The proposed Lakeland Irrigation Area Scheme (296GL dam on Palmer River) demonstrates growing regional water infrastructure investment that could create competitive dynamics or partnership opportunities. While Cape York is not core Sunwater territory, the water plan review processes (GABORA and Mitchell) establish regulatory approaches that may later apply to Sunwater schemes. The emphasis on "water literacy, governance improvements, and infrastructure investment" aligns with Sunwater's strategic priorities, suggesting potential collaboration opportunities in regional water development. Sunwater should monitor these reviews as they may influence Queensland's broader water policy framework affecting irrigation pricing, allocation mechanisms, and infrastructure investment models.

## Summary

Regional Development Australia (RDA) Tropical North chair Professor Hurriyet Babacan has called on stakeholders to actively participate in Queensland's review of water plans affecting Cape York, emphasizing the potential for water trading mechanisms to drive economic development in Far North Queensland. Speaking in June 2025, Professor Babacan highlighted that the region contains significant unallocated water resources and receives substantially more rainfall than other Australian regions, arguing that "we need to take a regional approach to water management and water resources." The reviews under consultation include the GABORA (Great Artesian Basin and Other Regional Aquifers) plan covering 70% of Queensland, and the Mitchell Water Plan governing water flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Professor Babacan identified three essential requirements for unlocking the region's water potential: improved water literacy, enhanced governance structures, and infrastructure investment. Central to her advocacy is the establishment of "a northern water trading mechanism" that would enable economic opportunities through more flexible water allocation and transfer systems. The water plan reviews carry direct implications for proposed regional projects, including the Lakeland Irrigation Area Scheme which envisions a 296-gigalitre dam on the Palmer River to irrigate 10,050 hectares of agricultural land. The scheme's viability depends partly on outcomes from the water plan review processes, which close for public consultation on August 30, 2025 (GABORA) and September 30, 2025 (Mitchell plan) respectively, with both reviews accessible through the Queensland Department of Business website.
