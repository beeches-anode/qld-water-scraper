title: Queensland councils revive plans for Nathan Dam with $3.4b-plus price tag

implications: Significant strategic and competitive implications for Sunwater's Central Queensland operations. Nathan Dam on the Dawson River (30km north-east of Taroom) would be a major new water infrastructure project in Sunwater's operational region, potentially competing for government funding and water allocation priorities. At $3.4 billion-plus (with $750M+ for the 700km pipeline alone), this represents one of Queensland's largest proposed water infrastructure investments, comparable in scale to Sunwater's Paradise Dam project ($4.4B). The project's 888-megalitre capacity and 700km pipeline to Toowoomba would serve urban, agricultural, and energy sectors - overlapping with Sunwater's customer base. Water Minister Ann Leahy's non-committal response signals tight government budget constraints that may affect Sunwater's own capital works funding requests. The century-long history of false starts (first proposed 1922, most recently stalled 2021) demonstrates the political and environmental complexity Sunwater faces with major dam projects. Environmental hurdles including the endangered boggomoss snail highlight the regulatory challenges Sunwater must navigate for infrastructure development. The regional council advocacy demonstrates growing water security pressures in agricultural regions that Sunwater serves, potentially increasing demand for Sunwater's existing infrastructure or creating competitive pressure for new supply sources.

## Summary

Two Queensland councils have renewed their push for Nathan Dam, a $3.4 billion-plus water infrastructure project first proposed in 1922 for the Dawson River near Taroom in central Queensland. Western Downs Regional Council (WDRC) published the revived plan in 2023, and Toowoomba Regional Council (TRC) formally endorsed it this week, while ruling out further investigation for a new dam at Emu Creek. The project would involve building an 888-megalitre dam 30 kilometres north-east of Taroom, along with a pipeline stretching more than 700 kilometres through the Western Downs to Toowoomba, with the pipeline alone expected to cost at least $750 million.

WDRC Mayor Andrew Smith described Nathan Dam as "the most critical water project in modern Queensland history," citing urgent urban, agricultural, and energy water needs. He noted that "water is becoming more like gold every day" and that many communities are approaching unsustainable water levels. Government AgTrends data showed the Toowoomba region was Queensland's top agricultural producer in 2023-24 with a gross value of production of $1.27 billion, followed by the Western Downs at $951 million. Toowoomba Deputy Mayor Rebecca Vonhoff, who holds the water portfolio, emphasized the need for long-term water planning despite all three regional dams being full, stating "we have to be pushing forward right now because this is exactly the time that we can try to make some big picture strategic decisions."

However, Banana Shire Mayor Nev Ferrier, whose region would host the dam, expressed skepticism about the project's viability. He questioned whether the dam would be big enough to serve its purpose and raised concerns about environmental hurdles, particularly referencing the boggomoss snail, an endangered species native to the area that has posed significant obstacles to past versions of the project. Water Minister Ann Leahy confirmed she was aware of the renewed advocacy and said the state was assessing water infrastructure projects across Queensland, including Nathan Dam, but would not confirm whether there was any funding for a feasibility study in the upcoming state budget, stating "we need to make sure we don't invest in things that don't stack up."
