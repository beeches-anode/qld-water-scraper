implications: The declaration of the Paradise Dam restoration as a Coordinated Project significantly streamlines the regulatory and approval pathway for Sunwater's largest capital project. This status enables Sunwater to partner directly with the Office of the Coordinator-General to expedite delivery of the $4.4 billion infrastructure rectification. For Sunwater, this reduces regulatory friction and provides a clear framework for stakeholder engagement with Bundaberg and North Burnett councils, while intensifying the imperative to deliver on schedule given the high political visibility and stated commitment to the region's $2 billion agricultural industry.

## Summary

The Queensland Coordinator-General has officially declared the restoration of Paradise Dam a "Coordinated Project," a move designed to fast-track the approval and consultation processes for the critical infrastructure works. This declaration by the Crisafulli Government aims to secure the long-term water supply for the Bundaberg region and its $2 billion agricultural and food manufacturing industry, following significant cost escalations that saw the project estimates reach $4.4 billion.

Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie and Minister for Water Ann Leahy announced the decision as a corrective measure to address previous delays and management issues. The coordinated project status allows for a streamlined delivery approach, enabling Sunwater to progress critical works more rapidly while ensuring statutory public consultation requirements are met. Early works are already underway at the site.

Queensland’s Coordinator-General, Gerard Coggan, confirmed his office is working closely with Sunwater as the proponent to facilitate the project through the approvals process. The partnership aims to foster strong collaboration between government agencies, local councils (North Burnett and Bundaberg), and community stakeholders to deliver the restored dam, which is essential for flood resilience and economic growth in the region.
