implications: Major reputational and financial implications for Sunwater as project proponent. The Estimates documents formalize the catastrophic cost escalation from $1.2 billion to $4.4 billion - a $3.2 billion blowout that dominates political discourse around the project. While the Crisafulli Government has committed to fast-tracking through Coordinator-General powers (coordinated project status declared August 8, 2025), Sunwater bears responsibility for delivering this generational infrastructure under intense public and parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister's statement that early works are "well advanced" and being scheduled around wet seasons demonstrates government confidence in Sunwater's project management, but the scale of cost overruns creates ongoing political risk. For Sunwater, successful delivery is critical to restore credibility after the original dam's concrete failures and subsequent cost escalations. The Estimates process establishes baseline accountability measures that Sunwater must report against throughout the multi-year delivery phase. This parliamentary documentation will be referenced for years as the project's fiscal and technical benchmark.

## Summary

In Questions on Notice compiled for the Queensland Parliament's August 2025 Estimates hearings, the Minister for Local Government and Water outlined the Crisafulli Government's commitment to rebuilding Paradise Dam and confirmed that the Coordinator-General has been directed to fast-track early works including geotechnical investigations and road upgrades. The ministerial response states that early works are "well advanced" and that Sunwater will schedule major construction activities around wet seasons while ensuring reliable water supply is maintained throughout the project delivery period. The document serves as an official parliamentary record establishing project status and government commitments during the 2025-26 budget estimates process held between July 28 and August 8, 2025.

Critically, the Estimates documentation confirms that under the previous government, the Paradise Dam rebuild cost increased by over $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion - a figure representing roughly half of the total $6.5 billion blowout in Queensland's water infrastructure program. This cost escalation from an initial $1.2 billion estimate has become a central reference point in subsequent political and media discussions about project risk and accountability. The Minister's responses emphasize the new government's commitment to delivering the project despite the cost increases, positioning Paradise Dam restoration as foundational infrastructure for regional growth and opportunity across the Bundaberg and Burnett regions. Following these Estimates hearings, the Coordinator-General formally declared Paradise Dam a coordinated project on August 8, 2025, providing streamlined approval processes to accelerate delivery while maintaining community consultation requirements. The document establishes the parliamentary accountability framework that will govern Sunwater's delivery of Queensland's most expensive and scrutinized water infrastructure project.
