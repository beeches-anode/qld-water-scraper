implications: Benchmarking value for Sunwater's infrastructure delivery and demonstrates Queensland Government water security investment priorities. The $472M project ($195M each from Australian and Queensland governments via National Water Grid Fund) shows significant federal and state commitment to water infrastructure, which may signal broader funding availability for Sunwater's capital works programs. At 50% completion with 850+ workers and $59M in local business spending, the project provides useful cost and delivery benchmarks for Sunwater's own major infrastructure projects like Paradise Dam. While this is urban water supply (Cairns Regional Council) versus Sunwater's primarily agricultural bulk water supply, the project demonstrates the competitive water infrastructure landscape in Far North Queensland where Sunwater operates the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme. The mid-2026 completion timeline and John Holland contractor selection offer market intelligence for Sunwater's project planning. The emphasis on First Nations employment (104 workers) and local business participation aligns with Sunwater's own community engagement priorities for major projects.

## Summary

The Cairns Water Security Stage 1 project has reached a major milestone with 50 percent of construction now complete, representing significant progress on the $472 million water security initiative for the Cairns region. The project is jointly funded by the Australian Government ($195 million through the National Water Grid Fund), Queensland Government ($195 million), and Cairns Regional Council, with construction on track for completion in mid-2026, weather permitting. Key construction achievements include completion of all concrete works for the new water treatment plant, completion of concrete works for the 8 megalitre and 5 megalitre reservoirs, installation of 12 kilometers of the planned 30-kilometer distribution network pipeline between Aloomba, Behana Gorge and Gordonvale, and commencement of construction on the three-storey control building.

The project has generated substantial local economic benefits, with more than 850 workers employed including 104 First Nations workers, and more than $59 million invested with 140 local businesses across a range of industries. Four First Nations businesses have supplied goods and services to the project. More than 4,800 cubic meters of concrete has been poured across the project to date, including 1,500 cubic meters for the dissolved air flotation and filtration plant and 1,260 cubic meters for the two reservoirs. The 8 megalitre reservoir required a 14-meter cut into the hill, removing more than 30,000 cubic meters of material including approximately 5,000 cubic meters of softer material and 25,000 cubic meters of rock in varying strengths.

Cairns Regional Council Mayor Amy Eden described this as "the largest project ever undertaken by Cairns Regional Council" and emphasized that it addresses growing pressure on the city's water system from population growth and tourism. Federal Member for Leichhardt Matt Smith noted the project was a priority during the last Federal Election, while State Member for Barron River Bree James highlighted that Cairns' thriving population and booming tourism sector have put strain on water supplies, making this work vital to ensure reliable water access. The project represents a significant example of three levels of government working in partnership to deliver water security infrastructure for regional Queensland.
