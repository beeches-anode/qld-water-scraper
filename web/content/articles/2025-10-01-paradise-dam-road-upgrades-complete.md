implications: Successful delivery of critical enabling infrastructure demonstrates Sunwater's project execution capability ahead of major dam construction. The $11 million road upgrade package - completing three separate road improvement programs - addresses access, safety, and flood resilience requirements essential for multi-year construction logistics. The new Degilbo Creek bridge (57m long, 4m higher flood immunity) specifically reduces project delay risk by ensuring reliable access during wet seasons when the $4.4B dam construction will be most vulnerable to disruption. Completion of intersection upgrades at Bruce Highway/Booyal-Dallarnil Road and 27 Paradise Dam Road improvement locations demonstrates Sunwater's coordination with transport authorities and local councils. The project's support for 50 regional jobs during enabling works (with 120 jobs currently supported across all enabling activities) provides positive community relations benefits in the Bundaberg region where Paradise Dam remains politically sensitive. Timely delivery of these prerequisite works positions Sunwater to commence major construction following the early 2026 detailed business case approval, maintaining project momentum after the June 2025 early works designation and August 2025 coordinated project declaration.

## Summary

Sunwater announced on October 1, 2025 that crucial road improvements for the Paradise Dam Improvement Project are now complete, following construction of infrastructure designed to improve safety and accommodate increased traffic movements during construction of the new dam wall. The $11 million upgrade package represents the final of three road programs delivered to support the project, with key works including a new 57-meter dual-lane bridge at Degilbo Creek (7 kilometers from Paradise Dam) built 4 meters higher than the previous causeway crossing to significantly improve flood immunity, reduce road closures, and minimize construction delays. The bridge construction, delivered by Harrison Infrastructure Group (design) and Hazell Brothers (construction), includes a new bridge approach road and reconfiguration of the Coringa Road and Paradise Dam Road intersection.

Additional roadworks completed as part of the dam project include upgrades to major intersections at Booyal-Dallarnil Road/Bruce Highway and Booyal-Dallarnil Road/Paradise Dam Road (both delivered by Hazell Brothers), plus improvements at 27 locations across a 10-kilometer section of Paradise Dam Road. These improvements, designed by Harrison Infrastructure Group and delivered by Civil Mining and Construction, encompassed road realignments, grade improvements, crest widening, drainage works, bitumen resurfacing, line marking, and signage upgrades. The road improvement program supported approximately 50 jobs, including contractors and suppliers from the Bundaberg and Burnett region. Current enabling works across the broader Paradise Dam project are supporting 120 jobs regionally. Following the Queensland Government's approval of early works designation in June 2025 and coordinated project declaration in August 2025 to streamline approvals processes, Sunwater is progressing toward major construction with the detailed business case anticipated for government decision in early 2026. The completed road upgrades provide critical access infrastructure to support the multi-year construction timeline for the new Paradise Dam wall replacement project.
