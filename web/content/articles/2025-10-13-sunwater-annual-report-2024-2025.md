## Summary

Sunwater's Annual Report for 2024-2025, covering the financial year ended 30 June 2025 and published in October 2025, outlines the organization's progress on prioritizing water security through critical infrastructure projects across Queensland. The report confirms that work is progressing on a new Paradise Dam wall on the Burnett River to ensure reliable water supply for the Bundaberg region, with Sunwater and alliance partners focused on safely completing preparatory activities required for major construction. During 2024-25, enabling and preparatory works continued on Bruce Highway, Booyal-Dallarnil Road and Paradise Dam Road, with three meetings of the independently chaired Paradise Dam Reference Group (PDRG) held throughout the year to maintain community consultation.

The report documents Sunwater's role implementing Queensland Government water policy initiatives, including the May 2025 announcement that set irrigation prices for 2025-26 to 2026-27 and continued the 15% discount for eligible irrigators who can apply for rebates through QRIDA. Sunwater manages Queensland's bulk water infrastructure network comprising 19 dams, 64 weirs and barrages, 595 kilometers of water channels, and 1,951 kilometers of pipeline serving agricultural, industrial, and urban customers. Strategic technology initiatives progressed during 2024-25, with Smart Schemes deployment beginning in the Dawson River Water Supply Scheme, and three additional schemes (Upper Condamine, Nogoa Mackenzie, and Boyne River and Tarong WSSs) planned for completion over the next five years. The report provides comprehensive accountability on Sunwater's governance, operational performance, safety outcomes, environmental compliance, and financial sustainability during a critical period of major infrastructure investment and regulatory change. Led by CEO Glenn Stockton AM and Non-Executive Chair Dr Lisa Caffery, Sunwater's annual report serves as the primary statutory transparency document for parliamentary oversight, stakeholder engagement, and customer accountability across the organization's diverse water supply operations.
