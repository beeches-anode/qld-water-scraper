implications: "Very high strategic significance. GAWB CEO Darren Barlow's perspective provides critical insights into the business case and stakeholder value proposition for major water infrastructure investments. The $983M Fitzroy to Gladstone Pipeline demonstrates how water security projects can be positioned to deliver multiple value streams: direct water supply (30 GL/year), economic security ($6B regional economy support), employment outcomes (400+ construction jobs, 21 trainees), and local economic stimulus ($150M regional investment, $590M+ total Australian business engagement). The 43% Awoonga Dam capacity driver reinforces the importance of diversified water sources - directly relevant to Sunwater's multi-dam portfolio strategy. The CEO's emphasis on \"water security rather than demand expansion\" provides messaging lessons for infrastructure advocacy. The workforce development component (traineeship program) offers a template for Sunwater's own major projects to deliver social license and regional employment benefits. This article exemplifies best-practice stakeholder communication for large-scale water infrastructure projects."

## Summary

Darren Barlow, Chief Executive Officer of Gladstone Area Water Board (GAWB), has outlined the comprehensive benefits of the $983 million Fitzroy to Gladstone Pipeline (FGP), emphasizing that the project represents far more than infrastructure—it's a vital connection delivering jobs, skills development, and water security for Central Queensland.

Writing in Inside Water, Barlow explains that with Awoonga Dam at 43% capacity as of October 2025, the FGP provides critical water security for Gladstone's major industries, which generate approximately $6 billion annually to Queensland's economy and sustain around 13,000 direct and indirect regional jobs. The pipeline will deliver 30 gigalitres of raw water annually from the Lower Fitzroy River to Gladstone's existing network.

Construction is nearing completion, having already created over 400 jobs and supported 21 trainees across various trades and professions. The project has invested more than $150 million with local businesses in Rockhampton and Gladstone, with total Australian business engagement exceeding $590 million.

### Project Rationale and Context

Barlow emphasizes that the FGP addresses **water security** rather than demand expansion, correcting misconceptions about the project's purpose. With GAWB currently allocating 78 gigalitres annually from Awoonga Dam to regional customers, the diversification of water sources through the FGP is essential for maintaining reliable supply to major industries, particularly energy production facilities.

### Infrastructure Components

The 117-kilometre raw water pipeline system includes:
- **Intake facility** at Laurel Bank on the Lower Fitzroy River
- **Sediment removal facility** at Alton Downs
- **Storage reservoirs** at Aldoga
- Connection to GAWB's existing Gladstone water network

### Economic and Employment Impact

**Construction Phase Benefits:**
- 400+ jobs created during construction
- 21 trainees supported across various trades
- $150 million invested with Rockhampton and Gladstone businesses
- $234 million with Queensland businesses
- $206 million with interstate Australian suppliers
- **Total Australian investment:** $590+ million

**Operational Phase Value:**
- Secures water supply for industries contributing ~$6 billion annually to Queensland's economy
- Supports approximately 13,000 direct and indirect regional jobs
- Delivers 30 gigalitres of raw water annually
- Addresses declining Awoonga Dam capacity (currently 43%)

### CEO Perspective on Water Infrastructure

Darren Barlow's commentary positions the FGP as "more than steel and concrete," highlighting the multiple value dimensions of major water infrastructure:
1. **Water security:** Diversifying supply sources to manage risk
2. **Economic security:** Protecting industries and jobs dependent on reliable water
3. **Workforce development:** Creating employment and training opportunities
4. **Regional investment:** Stimulating local and Queensland businesses

This comprehensive value proposition demonstrates how water infrastructure projects can serve as catalysts for broader regional economic and social benefits while delivering their core water supply function.
