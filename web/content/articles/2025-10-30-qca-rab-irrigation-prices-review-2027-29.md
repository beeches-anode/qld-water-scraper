implications: Fundamental shift in Sunwater's revenue recovery model with major financial and customer relations implications. The transition from annuity-based to RAB-based pricing represents the most significant change to Sunwater's irrigation pricing methodology in years. Under the previous annuity model, customers paid a constant amount covering up to 30 years of forecast future renewals work. The RAB approach means customers will only pay for renewed assets currently contributing to their services - potentially reducing near-term price pressures but changing Sunwater's capital recovery cash flows. Sunwater must submit detailed business proposals by 27 February 2026 demonstrating RAB valuations, depreciation schedules, and rate of return assumptions across its 19 dam and 65 weir network. The review outcome will fundamentally reshape Sunwater's financial planning, asset management strategy, and customer pricing from July 2027. This represents both an opportunity to improve pricing transparency and predictability for customers, and a significant regulatory compliance burden requiring sophisticated asset valuation and cost allocation capabilities. Success in this review is critical for maintaining regulatory credibility and ensuring sustainable cost recovery for infrastructure renewals.

## Summary

On 30 October 2025, the Queensland Government directed the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) to investigate appropriate irrigation service prices using a regulated asset base (RAB) approach for the 2027-29 pricing period, covering irrigation schemes operated by Sunwater and Seqwater. The QCA published a guidance paper and formal notice on 7 November 2025, with business proposals from Sunwater and Seqwater due by 27 February 2026, after which formal public consultation will commence. The pricing methodology will be based on allowable costs consistent with the QCA's earlier 2025-26 to 2028-29 review, but adjusted to implement the RAB approach for recovering infrastructure renewals expenditure.

This investigation represents a fundamental shift from the previous annuity model, under which customers paid a constant amount reflecting forecast renewals costs over a 30-year horizon - effectively contributing towards future work not yet completed. The RAB methodology changes this structure so customers only pay for renewed assets that are currently in service and contributing to water delivery. The Queensland Government initially set prices for 2025-26 and 2026-27 but postponed the 2027-29 pricing decision specifically to allow time for this RAB review to be completed. This deliberate policy pause reflects government recognition that the pricing methodology change has significant implications for both water supply entities and irrigation customers across Queensland's rural schemes. Sunwater is actively consulting with irrigation customers through online sessions and Customer Advisory Committee briefings during November 2025, including providing an Irrigation Customer Invoice Calculator to help customers understand potential pricing impacts under different tariff scenarios. The QCA's review will establish the regulatory framework that governs irrigation infrastructure cost recovery for Sunwater and Seqwater from July 2027 onwards, making this one of the most consequential pricing investigations in Queensland's rural water sector.
