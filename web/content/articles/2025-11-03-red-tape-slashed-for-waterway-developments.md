implications: These regulatory reforms directly reduce operational and compliance burdens for Sunwater's asset maintenance program across its 65 weirs and 19 dams. By removing development application requirements for over 90% of waterway barrier works and repairs, Sunwater can accelerate routine maintenance and disaster recovery works without lengthy approval delays. The removal of fish passage requirements for 122,000 km of Western Queensland waterways specifically benefits Sunwater's remote infrastructure, potentially lowering project costs and administrative overheads. This aligns with Sunwater's strategic priority of efficient asset management and enhances financial viability for future weir and dam improvement projects.

## Summary

The Queensland Government has introduced significant regulatory reforms to streamline dam and weir developments, updating what it describes as "cumbersome requirements" to cut red tape. The new Accepted Development Requirements remove the need for development applications and approvals for over 90 per cent of waterway barrier works, culverts, disaster recovery works, and dam and weir repairs. Additionally, fish passage requirements have been removed for 122,000 kilometres of waterways in Western Queensland.

Queensland Minister for Local Government and Water, Ann Leahy, positioned the reforms as a "fresh start" that will reduce costs, time, and regulatory burdens for waterway projects, making more dam projects financially viable. Minister for Primary Industries Tony Perrett emphasized that the changes strike a balance between industry certainty and healthy fish populations, with a new Rural and Remote Council Fish Passage Support Team established to provide technical advice.

The Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) welcomed the changes, particularly the reduced regulatory burden for councils rebuilding after natural disasters. The reforms are part of the Crisafulli Government's broader plan to deliver generational water infrastructure and address the water security needs of a growing population.
