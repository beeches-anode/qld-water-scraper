implications: High strategic significance. GAWB's completion of the $983M, 117km Fitzroy to Gladstone Pipeline represents major competitive infrastructure development in Queensland's water sector. At $8.4M per kilometer, this project sets a new benchmark for large-scale raw water pipeline construction costs, significantly higher than the recent $2.5M/km East End treated water pipeline. The project demonstrates successful delivery of alternative water source solutions (river extraction vs dam dependency), which may inform Sunwater's own diversification strategies. GAWB's expanded capacity and enhanced water security position strengthens their competitive standing for industrial customers. Sunwater should monitor the operational performance and customer uptake when the pipeline becomes operational mid-2026, as this model could influence future infrastructure planning across Queensland's bulk water sector.

## Summary

The Gladstone Area Water Board (GAWB) has achieved a historic milestone with the installation of the final pipe section, officially connecting the Fitzroy River to Gladstone's water network. This marks the completion of pipeline construction for the $983 million Fitzroy to Gladstone Pipeline project, one of Queensland's most significant water infrastructure investments in recent years.

The 117-kilometer pipeline stretches from the Lower Fitzroy River in Rockhampton to Yarwun in Gladstone, providing a second major water source for the region's industrial customers. The project is expected to become fully operational by mid-2026, delivering long-term water security to support Gladstone's economic development and industrial growth.

The milestone represents the culmination of more than two years of major construction work, with the first pipe delivered to Gracemere in June 2023. The project has exceeded local supplier participation targets, demonstrating significant regional economic benefits throughout the construction phase.

### Project Details

- **Total Investment:** $983 million
- **Pipeline Length:** 117 kilometers (Lower Fitzroy River to Yarwun)
- **Construction Timeline:** June 2023 (first pipe delivery) to November 2025 (completion)
- **Operational Date:** Mid-2026 (expected)
- **Primary Beneficiaries:** Gladstone industrial water customers
- **Strategic Purpose:**
  - Second water source for Gladstone region
  - Addresses water supply risk from Awoonga Dam dependency
  - Long-term water security for GAWB customers
  - Supports regional economic development

### Regional Impact

The pipeline provides critical infrastructure to support Gladstone's position as a major industrial hub in Queensland. By diversifying the region's water sources beyond Awoonga Dam, GAWB is ensuring resilient water supply for existing industries while creating capacity for future economic growth.

The project represents one of the largest water infrastructure investments in Central Queensland's history and demonstrates the state government's commitment to supporting regional development through strategic water infrastructure.
