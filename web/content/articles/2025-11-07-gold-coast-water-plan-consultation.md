implications: Low direct operational impact but valuable for policy monitoring. While Gold Coast water supply operates independently from Sunwater's network, this draft water plan demonstrates the Queensland Government's "Watertight Water Security Plan" approach to regional water planning. The consultation process (23-day window closing 30 November 2025) and plan structure—covering water entitlements for agriculture, commercial uses, and underground water management—provide insights into state government priorities and regulatory frameworks that may influence future water plan amendments across Sunwater's operational areas. The emphasis on balancing population growth, economic development, environmental protection, and primary industry needs reflects planning considerations relevant to Sunwater's strategic engagement with regional water planning processes.
