implications: This draft plan directly regulates the Pioneer Valley Water Supply Scheme, a major Sunwater asset base in the Mackay region. The proposed flexibility in Unallocated Water Reserves and trading rules will influence Sunwater's ability to meet changing demand from agricultural and industrial customers. Additionally, strict environmental management strategies for seawater intrusion and Reef flows may impose operational constraints on release patterns from Sunwater's storages (e.g., Teemburra and Kinchant Dams). Active engagement during the consultation period is critical to ensuring the final plan aligns with Sunwater's operational capabilities and infrastructure management requirements.

## Summary

The Crisafulli Government has released the draft Pioneer Valley water plan for public consultation, fulfilling a key election commitment under the *Watertight Water Security Plan*. The draft plan aims to secure long-term water reliability for the Mackay region, which supports a population of over 126,000 and key sectors including agriculture, tourism, and resources. Consultation is open until 19 December 2025.

Proposed changes in the draft plan focus on balancing user needs with environmental protection, including managing seawater intrusion and maintaining freshwater flows to the Great Barrier Reef. Key features include continued flexibility in water trading, allowing access to up to 5 megalitres of surface water for low-risk activities, and improving the flexibility for releasing Unallocated Water Reserves.

Minister for Local Government and Water, Ann Leahy, emphasized that the plan is designed to manage water resources for the coming decade. The process has been informed by scientific assessments and stakeholder engagement to address local issues and cultural water needs.
