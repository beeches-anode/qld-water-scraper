implications: Moderate strategic importance for Sunwater's Far North Queensland operations. The draft regional plan identifies "affordable and reliable water systems" as a key infrastructure priority for eight LGAs covering areas where Sunwater operates significant water schemes including the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme (Tinaroo Dam, 406,700 ML capacity) and Barron River systems. The projected population growth from 264,555 (2021) to 341,360-378,340 by 2046 represents a 29-43% increase, which will drive urban and agricultural water demand across the region. The public consultation period (open until 11:59pm Monday, 5 January 2026) provides an opportunity for Sunwater to engage with the planning process and ensure water infrastructure considerations are appropriately integrated into regional growth strategies. The plan's emphasis on "efficient and resilient infrastructure" aligns with Sunwater's asset management priorities and may influence future capital works planning for Far North Queensland schemes.

## Summary

The Queensland Government has released the draft **Far North Queensland Regional Plan 2025** for public consultation, with the consultation period open until 11:59pm Monday, 5 January 2026. Last updated on 13 November 2025, the plan provides strategic direction for regional development across eight local government areas in Far North Queensland over the next two decades.

The plan emphasizes "supporting efficient and resilient transport infrastructure while managing more affordable and reliable water and energy systems" as a key regional outcome. Water infrastructure is identified as one of five critical infrastructure classes requiring coordinated regional planning, alongside transport, energy, digital connectivity, and social infrastructure.

The region is projected to grow significantly, with the population expected to increase from 264,555 (2021) to between 341,360 and 378,340 by 2046, representing growth of 29-43%. This population increase will place additional demands on the region's water supply systems, making water infrastructure planning a critical component of the regional strategy.

### Coverage Area

The Far North Queensland Regional Plan covers eight local government areas:

1. **Cairns Regional Council**
2. **Cassowary Coast Regional Council**
3. **Douglas Shire Council**
4. **Etheridge Shire Council**
5. **Mareeba Shire Council**
6. **Tablelands Regional Council**
7. **Wujal Wujal Aboriginal Shire Council**
8. **Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council**

### Key Infrastructure Themes

The plan identifies five infrastructure classes requiring regional coordination:

- **Transport:** Road, rail, port, and airport infrastructure
- **Water:** Affordable and reliable water supply systems
- **Energy:** Power generation and distribution networks
- **Digital Connectivity:** Telecommunications infrastructure
- **Social Infrastructure:** Community facilities, education, health services

### Water Infrastructure Focus

While specific water projects are not detailed in the published overview, the plan emphasizes the need for:

- **Affordability:** Managing water costs for residential, agricultural, and industrial users
- **Reliability:** Ensuring consistent water supply to support population growth and economic development
- **Efficiency:** Optimizing existing water infrastructure and planning for future expansion
- **Resilience:** Building water systems capable of withstanding climate variability and extreme weather events

### Consultation Process

**Consultation Period:** Open until 11:59pm Monday, 5 January 2026

The public consultation invites feedback from:

- Local governments and regional organizations
- Industry stakeholders and water users
- Community members and residents
- Infrastructure providers and utilities

The Queensland Government encourages stakeholders to review the draft plan and provide input on regional priorities, including water infrastructure planning, to help finalize the 2025 Regional Plan.

### Regional Context

Far North Queensland's diverse economy includes:

- **Tourism:** Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef region
- **Agriculture:** Sugarcane, tropical fruit, horticulture (particularly in Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation area)
- **Mining:** Mineral resources in western areas
- **Urban Development:** Growing residential and commercial centers

Water infrastructure planning must balance these competing demands while supporting sustainable regional growth and environmental protection.
