implications: Moderate competitive intelligence value. While GAWB operates independently from Sunwater, this $57M pipeline replacement project provides useful benchmarking data for Sunwater's own infrastructure renewal planning. At $2.5M per kilometer for a 23km treated water pipeline, this pricing can inform Sunwater's capital works budgeting for similar pipeline replacement projects across its 1,951km network. The project timeline (12 months for design-construct) and contractor selection (McConnell Dowell BMD JV) offer insights into market capacity and delivery models. As both organizations face similar aging infrastructure challenges, GAWB's approach to end-of-life asset replacement may provide lessons for Sunwater's asset management strategy.

## Summary

The Gladstone Area Water Board (GAWB) has awarded a $57 million contract to McConnell Dowell BMD Joint Venture (MBJV) for the design and construction of the East End pipeline project. The project involves replacing a 23-kilometer aging treated water pipeline that connects Boat Creek Pump Station to East End Reservoir, along with upgrades to the pump station to increase capacity and enhance system performance.

GAWB Chief Executive Officer Darren Barlow emphasized that the pipeline is "critical to maintaining a safe and reliable water supply for Gladstone's industries and the Mount Larcom community." The project supports long-term water security for both industrial operations and residential areas in the Gladstone region.

Major construction is scheduled to commence in early 2026, with project completion targeted for late 2026. GAWB has committed to maximizing local employment and supply chain participation opportunities during the construction phase, reinforcing the project's regional economic benefits.

### Project Details

- **Contract Value:** $57 million
- **Pipeline Length:** 23 kilometers (replacing end-of-life infrastructure)
- **Scope:** Pipeline replacement plus Boat Creek Pump Station upgrades
- **Timeline:** Early 2026 construction start, late 2026 completion
- **Contractor:** McConnell Dowell BMD Joint Venture (design-construct model)
- **Beneficiaries:** Gladstone industrial water users and Mount Larcom community

The project represents a significant infrastructure investment in Queensland's water supply network, addressing the critical need to replace aging assets that have reached the end of their operational life.
