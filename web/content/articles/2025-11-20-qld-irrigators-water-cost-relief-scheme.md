implications: Significant operational and customer relations impact. This rebate scheme directly affects Sunwater's agricultural customers across 19 dams and 65 weirs. Unlike the 2021 scheme where Sunwater applied discounts directly at invoice, the current model requires farmers to pay full price upfront and claim rebates through QRIDA separately. This creates customer relations challenges as irrigators may perceive administrative burden and cash flow issues despite the 15% discount. Sunwater should monitor whether the rebate process friction impacts water demand patterns, particularly for smaller operators who may find documentation requirements prohibitive. The scheme's administrative complexity highlights ongoing political sensitivity around irrigation pricing and signals potential future policy changes. Sunwater needs to maintain pricing system flexibility and strong agricultural stakeholder engagement.

## Summary

The Queensland Government has opened applications for a new rebate program offering a 15 per cent discount on water costs for irrigators across the state. The Crisafulli government is investing almost $51 million over two years to provide cost relief for primary producers, with the scheme administered by the Queensland Rural and Industry Development Authority (QRIDA). Applications opened in November 2025 and will remain open until December 31, 2027, targeting owner-operated irrigation businesses earning primary production income from Sunwater and Seqwater schemes.

However, the scheme has drawn criticism from irrigators over its administrative complexity. Unlike the Labor government's 2021 scheme which automatically applied a 15% discount at invoice, the current program requires farmers to estimate future water usage for the 2025/2026 and 2026/2027 years and provide extensive documentation proving their business irrigates before actually using the water. Farmers have expressed frustration at the bureaucratic burden, with one cotton grower noting the administrative costs of assessing applications would have been avoided if the discount was simply applied directly to invoices. The scheme requires at least two forms of supporting documentation, including management accounts, purchase invoices for irrigation equipment, Commonwealth Horticulture Levy statements, farm maps, aerial photography, or photos of irrigated areas.
