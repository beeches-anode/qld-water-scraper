implications: Moderate impact requiring operational adjustments. Sunwater will need to update trading platforms and customer communication materials to reflect new temporary transfer rules. The simplified trading process may increase transaction volumes, requiring additional administrative capacity. However, streamlined regulations should reduce compliance burden and improve customer satisfaction. Sunwater should proactively engage with the Department of Regional Development to ensure smooth implementation across all 31 bulk water schemes.

## Summary

The Queensland Government has announced significant reforms to water allocation trading rules, set to commence on January 1, 2026. The changes aim to simplify temporary water transfer processes and reduce administrative barriers for irrigators and water users.

Under the new framework, temporary transfers within the same water supply scheme will be approved within 5 business days (down from 20 days), and application fees will be reduced by 40%. The reforms respond to feedback from agricultural stakeholders who have long called for more flexible water trading mechanisms.

### Key Changes

- **Processing time:** Reduced from 20 to 5 business days for same-scheme transfers
- **Fee reduction:** 40% decrease in temporary transfer application fees
- **Digital platform:** New online portal for lodging transfer applications
- **Transparency:** Real-time dashboard showing available water allocations by scheme
- **Interstate trading:** Pilot program for Murray-Darling Basin cross-border trades

The Department of Regional Development's Water Policy Division conducted extensive consultation with water service providers, including Sunwater, Seqwater, and private irrigators. Deputy Director-General Mark Chen emphasized that "these reforms strike the right balance between regulatory oversight and market efficiency."

Industry groups have cautiously welcomed the changes, though some environmental advocates have raised concerns about ensuring adequate environmental flows are protected under the more flexible trading regime.

The reforms will apply to all regulated water supply schemes across Queensland, affecting approximately 22,000 water allocation holders statewide.
