implications: This auction represents the final release of water savings from the $32.54 million Mareeba-Dimbulah Efficiency Improvement Project, directly monetizing infrastructure improvements. By making 5,610 megalitres of medium priority water available to Tablelands farmers, Sunwater is optimizing water utilization across the scheme's 17,000 hectares. The successful sale following the earlier 2024 tranche validates the business case for modernization investments (14km pipeline, 125 automated gates) and supports regional agricultural expansion.

## Summary

Sunwater has announced an auction for 5,610 megalitres of medium priority water allocations in the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme, with parcels ranging from 5 to 200 megalitres. The auction, hosted on the Water Exchange platform with closing dates up to November 27, represents the final tranche of available allocations in the scheme. This follows the successful sale of 5,898 megalitres earlier in April and May 2024.

The water allocations were made available through water savings achieved by the $32.54 million Mareeba-Dimbulah Efficiency Improvement Project. This infrastructure modernization project, jointly funded by the Queensland Government ($20.94 million) and the Australian Government ($11.6 million), involved replacing 14km of pipeline, installing 125 automated control gates, and upgrading 157 water offtakes to enhance delivery efficiency across 17,000 hectares of farmland.

Lincoln Parr, Sunwater’s Ruralco water broker, is managing customer inquiries for the auction. Sunwater emphasized that the new infrastructure has improved responsiveness to water demands and reduced overflow losses, allowing the saved water to be redirected to productive agricultural use in the Far North Queensland region.
