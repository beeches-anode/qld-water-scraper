## Environmental Considerations

### Location and Context

The Big Rocks Weir is located on the Burdekin River, 320 km upstream of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The Burdekin River catchment has an annual discharge of 9.2 million megalitres and is the single largest source of suspended sediment to the Great Barrier Reef.

### Environmental Assessment Requirements

As a coordinated project, Big Rocks Weir must undergo a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement process addressing:
- Water quality impacts
- Aquatic ecosystem effects
- Downstream environmental impacts
- Great Barrier Reef considerations
- Terrestrial ecology
- Social and economic impacts

### Environmental Impact Analysis

**Project-Specific Assessment:**
Environmental assessments suggest that discernible changes in water quality at the Burdekin River mouth are not expected to occur as a result of Big Rocks Weir, with minimal impact anticipated due to the presence of Burdekin Falls Dam downstream.

**Conservation Group Concerns:**
Conservation organizations, including the North Queensland Conservation Council, have raised concerns about cumulative impacts. They note that Big Rocks Weir, combined with other proposed projects (Urannah Dam, Hells Gates Dam, and expansion of Burdekin Falls Dam), could contribute to increased nutrient flows to the Great Barrier Reef.

### Great Barrier Reef Considerations

The project's proximity to the Great Barrier Reef catchment requires careful assessment of:
- Potential sediment and nutrient load changes
- Cumulative impacts with other Burdekin Basin infrastructure
- Water quality outcomes for reef health
- Compliance with Great Barrier Reef protection measures

## Agricultural Benefits

### Water Security and Crop Diversification

The additional 10 GL of water storage will deliver water security to enable the Charters Towers region to transition from traditional grazing and seasonal crops to high-value perennial crops, including:
- Table grapes
- Avocados
- Mangoes
- Other high-value horticultural products

### Agricultural Development

- **Irrigation Area:** Up to 5,000 hectares of new or enhanced irrigated agricultural land
- **Annual Production Increase:** $35 million in additional agricultural output
- **Regional Benefit:** Supports agricultural diversification and economic resilience in the Charters Towers region

## Cultural Heritage

### Assessment Requirements

As part of the Environmental Impact Statement process, the project requires comprehensive cultural heritage assessments to:
- Identify Traditional Owner groups for the project area
- Assess potential impacts on Aboriginal cultural heritage
- Ensure compliance with Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act Qld 2003
- Develop appropriate consultation and mitigation frameworks

### Consultation Process

Cultural heritage consultation will be conducted as part of the EIS process, engaging with relevant Traditional Owner groups to identify and address cultural heritage values and concerns in the project area.

## Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

### Coordinated Project Status

Declared as a coordinated project by the Coordinator-General on March 29, 2021, requiring:
- Full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
