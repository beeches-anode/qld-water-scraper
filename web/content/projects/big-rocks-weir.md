environmentalRisks: Project located 320 km upstream of Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Environmental assessment suggests minimal water quality impact at Burdekin River mouth due to presence of Burdekin Falls Dam downstream. However, conservation groups have raised concerns about cumulative impacts of multiple water infrastructure projects on nutrient flows to the Great Barrier Reef. Full Environmental Impact Statement required as part of coordinated project approval process.
approvalsStatus: Declared coordinated project by Queensland Coordinator-General (March 2021). Undergoing full Environmental Impact Assessment process.

timeline: Detailed business case completed (August 2020) → Declared coordinated project (March 29, 2021) → Draft TOR for EIS released (May 2021) → Funding committed by both governments ($68M total) → Pre-construction funding allocated ($6M, 2022) → Council steps down as proponent (2024) → Queensland Government assumes proponent role → Project declaration lapse date extended to January 9, 2026 → EIS and approvals process ongoing
economicBenefits: Projected to create 172 full-time equivalent jobs during construction and over 110 ongoing jobs post-construction. Expected to generate an additional $35 million in agricultural production annually. Will deliver water security to enable transition to high-value perennial crops including table grapes, avocados, and mangoes. Supports regional economic growth and agricultural diversification in the Charters Towers region.

## Project Overview

Big Rocks Weir is a proposed 188-metre long weir on the Burdekin River in North Queensland. The project was originally conceived as downstream infrastructure for the Hells Gates Dam project, but continued as a standalone initiative after Hells Gates was discontinued in 2022-2023.

The weir aims to provide water security for the Charters Towers region, enabling a transition from traditional grazing and seasonal crops to high-value perennial agriculture including table grapes, avocados, and mangoes.

## Project History

The detailed business case was completed in August 2020 by Townsville Enterprise Limited with assistance from GHD and KPMG. On March 29, 2021, Queensland's Coordinator-General declared Big Rocks Weir a coordinated project, triggering the Environmental Impact Statement process.

Draft Terms of Reference for the EIS were released for public comment from May 10 to June 7, 2021. In 2022, $6 million in combined federal and state funding was allocated to commence pre-construction activities including environmental assessments, geotechnical studies, and detailed design work.

In 2024, Charters Towers Regional Council stepped down as proponent, transitioning responsibilities to the Queensland Government through Sunwater. The project declaration lapse date has been extended to January 9, 2026, with the Queensland Government currently reviewing project information through Sunwater to determine next steps.

## Environmental Considerations

The project is located 320 km upstream of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Environmental assessments suggest minimal water quality impact at the Burdekin River mouth due to the presence of Burdekin Falls Dam downstream.

Conservation organisations, including the North Queensland Conservation Council, have raised concerns about cumulative impacts of multiple Burdekin Basin infrastructure projects (Big Rocks Weir, Urannah Dam, Hells Gates Dam, and Burdekin Falls Dam expansion) on nutrient flows to the Great Barrier Reef.

## Cultural Heritage

Cultural heritage assessment is required as part of the EIS process. The assessment will identify Traditional Owner groups for the project area and evaluate potential impacts on Aboriginal cultural heritage in accordance with the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act Qld 2003.

## Regional Context

Big Rocks Weir is integrated into the broader Burdekin Basin water management framework alongside other initiatives including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Energy Storage Project and Burdekin Falls Dam Raising Project. Water made available by the weir would be managed within the Burdekin Basin water plan allocation framework.
