## Project Overview

The Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme Modernisation is a proposed infrastructure upgrade targeting Australia's largest east coast irrigation area. The scheme currently irrigates more than 50,000 hectares of farmland in the Lower Burdekin region through 387 km of channels and pipelines, primarily supporting sugarcane farming and horticulture.

Established in the early 1950s as a soldier settlement scheme, the infrastructure now requires modernisation to improve efficiency, reduce water losses from seepage, and address rising groundwater levels that threaten agricultural productivity.

## Project History

The Australian Government committed $1.9 million through the National Water Grid Fund in 2022 to develop a detailed business case. The study investigated infrastructure solutions including channel lining, new balancing storages, pipeline replacements for aging channel sections, and upgraded control and telemetry systems.

The detailed business case was completed in December 2023 and submitted to the Australian Government for consideration. The full report has not been made publicly available. Implementation funding decisions remain pending based on business case recommendations.

Several related projects have progressed in the region: the Warrens Gully System Capacity Upgrade was completed in February 2024 ($9.5 million, with $4.76 million federal funding), and the Lower Burdekin Rising Groundwater Mitigation Project has construction expected to commence mid-2025.

## Environmental Considerations

Rising groundwater levels and soil salinity represent major threats to agricultural production in the Lower Burdekin. Inefficient irrigation practices and seepage from unlined channels contribute to groundwater rise. The modernisation project targets this issue through infrastructure improvements expected to reduce groundwater inflows by 2,000-3,000 ML per year.

The Burdekin River flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, and agricultural runoff containing nutrients and sediments impacts reef water quality. Environmental values and water quality objectives for the Burdekin, Haughton and Don basins were approved in 2022, providing the regulatory framework for water quality management.

## Cultural Heritage

Cultural heritage assessments have not yet been conducted, pending the project implementation decision. Multiple Traditional Owner groups have connection to the Burdekin region, with specific groups to be identified based on the final project footprint. Cultural heritage surveys will be required prior to any construction activities, with engagement following best practice frameworks.

## Regional Context

The project sits within the broader framework of the Burdekin Basin Water Plan, currently under review. Recovery of 15-20 GL of additional water for allocation must be considered within this water plan review process.

Related infrastructure initiatives include the Burdekin Falls Dam Raising project, the Burdekin Regional Water Assessment, and the Haughton Pipeline Project (Townsville City Council). The modernisation project is part of the Queensland Connections Package under the National Water Grid.
