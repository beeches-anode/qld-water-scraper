The Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme was established in the early 1950s as a soldier settlement scheme on 7,500 hectares of the lower Burdekin floodplain around Clare, Millaroo, and Dalbeg. Over the following decades, the scheme expanded significantly to become Australia's largest east coast irrigation area, supporting over 50,000 hectares of primarily sugarcane farming and horticulture.

The scheme operates by diverting water from the Burdekin River via pumping stations in the Clare Weir area. Water is distributed through an extensive network of 387 km of channels and pipelines to customers across the Lower Burdekin region. The infrastructure includes the Haughton, Barratta, and Elliot main channels, along with associated weirs and storages.

After decades of operation, the aging infrastructure began experiencing challenges including:
- Water losses through seepage from unlined channels
- Rising groundwater levels exacerbated by irrigation practices
- Increasing maintenance costs for aging infrastructure
- Limited operational flexibility and monitoring capabilities
- Soil salinity issues affecting agricultural productivity

- Limited monitoring and control capabilities compared to modern systems
- Unintended consequences like rising groundwater from prolonged irrigation
- Need for staged modernisation over many decades

**Rising Groundwater as Long-term Impact:**
The rising groundwater and salinity issues in the Lower Burdekin illustrate the long-term cumulative impacts of irrigation development. Initial scheme design did not anticipate groundwater rise from sustained irrigation and channel seepage. This highlights the importance of:
- Long-term environmental monitoring and adaptive management
- Understanding cumulative impacts over decades
- Groundwater modeling and management in irrigation areas
- Integration of infrastructure design with groundwater outcomes

#### Best Practices

**Comprehensive Business Case:**
Development of a detailed business case before implementation represents best practice in major infrastructure planning. The business case provides government with robust information for investment decisions and establishes a clear framework for project development.

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
Involvement of Lower Burdekin Water, agricultural customers, and other stakeholders throughout business case development helps ensure the project addresses real operational needs and has community support.

**Integration with Regional Planning:**
The project's integration with broader Burdekin Basin water planning, groundwater mitigation initiatives, and regional development strategies demonstrates a systems approach to water infrastructure development.

**Environmental and Cultural Heritage Consideration:**
Recognition that environmental assessment and cultural heritage protection are fundamental requirements, not afterthoughts, sets appropriate expectations for project development.

#### Challenges

**Funding Major Infrastructure Modernisation:**
Securing implementation funding for large-scale modernisation projects remains a significant challenge. While the business case is complete, converting that into committed implementation funding requires:
- Demonstration of strong benefit-cost ratio
- Alignment with government priorities
- Appropriate sharing of costs between government levels and beneficiaries
- Competition with other infrastructure priorities

**Balancing Multiple Objectives:**
The project must balance:
- Agricultural water recovery and allocation
- Environmental flow requirements
- Groundwater management objectives
- Cultural heritage protection
- Economic viability and cost-effectiveness
- Great Barrier Reef water quality improvement

Managing these competing objectives through project design and regulatory approvals is complex.

**Public Availability of Information:**
The detailed business case report has not been made publicly available, limiting transparency and public understanding of project merits, costs, and recommendations. While commercially sensitive information may require confidentiality, greater transparency in business case outcomes would support informed public discussion.

#### Legacy

**Infrastructure Modernisation Model:**
The Burdekin Haughton modernisation project may serve as a model for other aging irrigation schemes across Australia facing similar challenges. The business case approach, infrastructure solutions investigated, and stakeholder engagement framework could inform modernisation efforts elsewhere.

**National Water Grid Demonstration:**
As a National Water Grid Fund project, this initiative demonstrates Commonwealth investment in critical irrigation infrastructure modernisation. Project outcomes will inform future National Water Grid priorities and funding decisions.

**Regional Sustainability:**
If implemented, the project could provide a legacy of:
- Sustained agricultural productivity in the Lower Burdekin for generations
- Improved environmental outcomes through reduced groundwater impacts
- More efficient water use supporting regional water security
- Modern infrastructure supporting regional economic growth
- Model for balancing agricultural development with environmental protection

#### Future Implications

**For Water Infrastructure Planning:**
The project demonstrates that even successful historical infrastructure developments require ongoing investment in modernisation to remain viable. This has implications for:
- Long-term asset management and renewal planning for irrigation schemes
- Recognition that infrastructure modernisation is an ongoing need, not one-time investment
- Importance of funding mechanisms for infrastructure renewal

**For Burdekin Basin Management:**
Project outcomes will influence:
- Future water allocation decisions in the Burdekin Basin Water Plan
- Approaches to groundwater management in irrigation areas
- Balance between agricultural expansion and environmental protection
- Integration of infrastructure investment with water planning

**For Great Barrier Reef Protection:**
More efficient irrigation infrastructure in the Burdekin catchment could contribute to Great Barrier Reef water quality improvement targets, demonstrating that agricultural productivity and reef protection can be mutually reinforcing objectives when supported by appropriate infrastructure.

#### Comparable Projects

The Burdekin Haughton modernisation can be compared to:
- **Murray-Darling Basin irrigation modernisation projects:** Similar challenges of aging infrastructure and water recovery
- **Other National Water Grid projects:** Part of broader national portfolio of water infrastructure investment
- **Queensland irrigation scheme upgrades:** Similar to other Sunwater scheme modernisation initiatives
- **International irrigation modernisation:** Comparable to modernisation efforts in other developed agricultural economies

The project's scale, complexity, and integration of water recovery with groundwater management objectives position it as a significant case study in irrigation infrastructure modernisation.
