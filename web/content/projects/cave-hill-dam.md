## Project Overview

The Cave Hill Dam is a proposed major water infrastructure project on the Cloncurry River in North West Queensland, conceived to address growing water demand from potential irrigated agriculture expansion and mining sector requirements. The project proponent, Mount Isa to Townsville Economic Zone Inc (MITEZ), commissioned Jacobs Group to undertake comprehensive feasibility studies between 2017 and 2019, funded by $1.765 million from the Australian Government's National Water Infrastructure Development Fund.

The Cave Hill site was identified as the most suitable location for a dam capable of supporting agricultural development, positioned upstream of more than 70,000 hectares of soils suitable for irrigation. The proposed dam would also provide water supplies to existing and future mining operations in the region, including Ernest Henry Mining, CopperChem Great Australia, Cudeco Rocklands Group, and MMG Dugald River, while enhancing water security for Cloncurry township.

The detailed business case completed in June 2019 concluded that while the project was technically feasible, the costs associated with development were likely to outweigh the benefits under current economic conditions. The project has been placed on hold, with MITEZ positioning the completed feasibility work for potential future development should circumstances change.

## Project History

The project emerged from regional water planning processes recognising growing water demand in North West Queensland. In 2017, MITEZ secured NWIDF funding and engaged Jacobs to undertake technical investigations. The preliminary business case delivered in November 2017 identified Cave Hill as the preferred site.

Geotechnical investigations in 2018 confirmed subsurface conditions were appropriate for dam construction. The optimum design was identified as a zoned earth and rock fill embankment dam with an earth fill embankment saddle dam. Construction costs were estimated at $250 million for a 248GL storage capacity.

The Jacobs team initiated dialogue with the Mitakoodi and Mayi people, Native Title applicants for the area, who were invited to share insights about the cultural significance of the project area. This consultation was incorporated into the feasibility assessment.

The June 2019 detailed business case found that while opportunities may exist for irrigated agriculture around Cloncurry, viability was contingent on both dam infrastructure economics and agricultural supply chain feasibility. Market conditions at the time did not support proceeding.

In 2020, MITEZ prepared an Investment Prospectus to position the project for future consideration. Renewed interest emerged in 2023 following the Copperstring 2.0 electricity transmission project announcement, which is expected to unlock significant new mining development in the region, potentially increasing water demand and improving the economic case for the dam.

## Regional Context

The project sits within the Gulf Water Plan area, specifically the Flinders River catchment. The Gulf Water Resource Plan provides general unallocated water reserves of 239,650 megalitres in the Flinders catchment. The Cave Hill Dam was conceived as potential infrastructure to enable utilisation of these reserves for productive purposes.

In 2024, the Queensland Government initiated a review of the Gulf Water Plan, responding to concerns that it does not effectively support growth in irrigated agriculture and the emerging critical minerals industry. Water allocation processes in the Flinders catchment have been complex, with 110,000ML of general reserve unallocated water released, though in March 2024 the Department of Resources decided not to progress any tenders.

Cloncurry's current water supply relies on Lake Julius. The Cave Hill Dam would provide storage 2.1 times larger than Lake Julius, significantly enhancing water security for the township and providing resilience against drought and climate variability.

The connection between Copperstring 2.0 and Cave Hill Dam viability illustrates the interdependence of regional infrastructure. Mayor Andrew Daniels noted that Copperstring would unlock billions of dollars in new mining projects south of Cloncurry, creating new water demand that could improve the dam's economic case.
