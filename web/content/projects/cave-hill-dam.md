## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Cave Hill Dam is a proposed major water infrastructure project on the Cloncurry River in North West Queensland. The project was conceived to address growing water demand in the Cloncurry region, driven by potential expansion of irrigated agriculture and increased water requirements from the mining sector. Located approximately 20 kilometers upstream of the Cloncurry township, the proposed dam site is strategically positioned to capture water from the Cloncurry River, which forms part of the larger Flinders River catchment within the Gulf Water Plan area.

The project proponent is Mount Isa to Townsville Economic Zone Inc (MITEZ), a not-for-profit regional economic development organization that advocates for infrastructure development across North West Queensland. MITEZ commissioned leading engineering consultancy Jacobs Group (Australia) Pty Limited to undertake comprehensive feasibility studies, funded by $1.765 million from the Australian Government's National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF).

The feasibility studies, conducted between 2017 and 2019, identified Cave Hill as the most suitable site for a dam capable of supporting irrigated agriculture development in the Cloncurry region. The site is located upstream of a significant area (more than 70,000 hectares) of soils identified as suitable for irrigation, making it strategically positioned to enable agricultural development. The project also aimed to provide reliable water supplies to existing and future mining operations in the region, including Ernest Henry Mining, CopperChem Great Australia, Cudeco Rocklands Group, and MMG Dugald River, as well as enhance water security for the Cloncurry township.

However, the detailed business case completed in June 2019 concluded that, while technically feasible, the costs associated with the proposed development were likely to outweigh the benefits under current economic conditions. As a result, the project has been placed on hold, with MITEZ positioning the work for potential future development should circumstances change to improve the project's economic viability.

The broader regional context includes significant water planning activities in the Gulf area, with amendments to the Gulf Water Resource Plan providing general unallocated water reserves of 239,650 megalitres in the Flinders River catchment. The Cave Hill Dam proposal fits within this framework as potential infrastructure to enable utilization of these water allocations for productive use.

### Key Specifications

- **Capacity/Scale:**
  - Storage capacity: 248 gigalitres (GL)
  - Comparative scale: 2.1 times the size of Lake Julius, Cloncurry's current primary water source
  - Note: Some sources reference approximately 140,000 megalitres, which may represent an alternative design or earlier estimate

- **Infrastructure Components:**
  - **Main dam:** Zoned earth and rock fill embankment dam (optimum design identified in feasibility study)
  - **Saddle dam:** Earth full embankment saddle dam
  - **Location:** Cave Hill site on Cloncurry River, ~20km south of Cloncurry township
  - **Catchment area:** Upper Cloncurry River catchment

- **Design Features:**
  - Geotechnical investigations indicated subsurface conditions appropriate for foundations of various dam types
  - Zoned earth and rock fill construction identified as optimum design
  - Site positioned to serve irrigation area of >70,000 ha of suitable soils downstream

- **Operational Parameters:**
  - Intended to support multiple water use sectors: irrigated agriculture, mining, municipal supply
  - Water allocation mechanisms would need to be developed in accordance with Gulf Water Plan
  - Supply to both existing users (Cloncurry township, existing mines) and new developments (irrigated agriculture precinct, future mining operations)

### Project History and Status

#### Initial Conception and Preliminary Investigation (2016-2017)

The Cave Hill Dam concept emerged from regional water planning processes in North West Queensland, driven by recognition of growing water demand from the mining sector and potential for irrigated agriculture development in the Cloncurry region. MITEZ identified the need for increased water storage capacity to support regional economic development and enhance water security for the Cloncurry township, which relies on Lake Julius.

In 2017, MITEZ successfully secured $1.765 million in funding from the Australian Government's National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF) to conduct comprehensive feasibility studies. MITEZ engaged Jacobs Group (Australia) Pty Limited, a leading international engineering consultancy, to undertake the technical investigations.

#### Feasibility Study Phase (2017-2019)

The feasibility study was structured in multiple phases:

**Preliminary Business Case (2017):** The first phase involved assessing the estimated demand for new water entitlements in the Cloncurry area and identifying potential dam sites. The preliminary business case, delivered in November 2017, identified Cave Hill as the most suitable site for a dam that could support irrigated agriculture development. The site's location approximately 20km upstream of Cloncurry and above more than 70,000 hectares of irrigation-suitable soils made it the preferred option.

**Geotechnical Investigations (2018):** Detailed geotechnical investigations were conducted at the Cave Hill site to assess subsurface conditions and suitability for dam construction. The investigations indicated that the subsurface conditions may be appropriate for the foundations of a variety of dam types, confirming the technical feasibility of construction at the site.

**Functional Design and Costings (2018):** Jacobs developed detailed functional designs for the dam infrastructure. The optimum construction design was identified as a zoned earth and rock fill embankment dam with an earth full embankment saddle dam. The storage capacity was determined to be 248 gigalitres, representing 2.1 times the capacity of the existing Lake Julius. Construction costs were estimated at $250 million.

**Social, Economic and Environmental Impact Assessments (2018-2019):** Comprehensive assessments were undertaken to evaluate the potential impacts and benefits of the project. These included economic modeling of potential water demand from irrigated agriculture and mining, assessment of regional economic development impacts, and preliminary environmental impact considerations.

**Cultural Heritage Consultation (2018-2019):** The Jacobs team initiated dialogue with the local applicants for Native Title - the Mitakoodi and Mayi people - who were invited to share insights about the cultural significance of the area. This consultation process was incorporated into the overall feasibility assessment.

#### Detailed Business Case (2019)

The detailed business case, completed in June 2019, represented the culmination of the feasibility study work. It provided comprehensive assessment of the potential costs and benefits of the Cave Hill Dam project. The critical finding was that, while the project was technically feasible and strategically aligned with regional development goals, the costs associated with the proposed development were likely to outweigh the benefits under current economic conditions.

The assessment of demand for water showed that there may be opportunities to establish an irrigated agricultural sector around Cloncurry, but this was contingent on the financial and economic viability of both the dam infrastructure and the agricultural supply chains. The business case concluded that market conditions at the time did not support proceeding with the project.

#### Investment Prospectus and Positioning (2020)

Following completion of the detailed business case, MITEZ prepared a Cave Hill Dam Investment Prospectus in 2020. This document was designed to position the project for potential future development should circumstances change. MITEZ used remaining NWIDF funds to identify and document activities that could be undertaken in the future if changes in water demand, commodity prices, or other factors improved the project's economic viability.

#### Renewed Interest (2023)

In 2023, renewed interest in the Cave Hill Dam emerged following the announcement of the Copperstring 2.0 electricity infrastructure project. This major transmission line project is designed to connect North West Queensland to the National Electricity Market and is expected to unlock significant new mining development, particularly for critical minerals.

Cloncurry Shire Council Mayor Andrew Daniels noted that the state's investment in Copperstring would unlock billions of dollars in new mining projects, many of which are located south of Cloncurry. This development provided renewed context for the Cave Hill Dam, as the new mining activity could significantly increase water demand, potentially improving the economic case for the dam. The 2023 reference to the dam indicated a capacity of approximately 140,000 megalitres and emphasized its strategic positioning to support new mining projects.

#### Current Status (2024-Present)

As of late 2024 and into 2025, the Cave Hill Dam project remains in a holding pattern. The comprehensive feasibility work and detailed business case have been completed and documented, providing a strong technical foundation for future consideration. However, no regulatory approvals have been sought, no engineering design work has progressed beyond the feasibility phase, and no funding has been committed for construction.

The project's future depends on changes in regional economic conditions, particularly:
- Increased water demand from mining sector expansion (potentially driven by Copperstring 2.0)
- Development of viable irrigated agriculture businesses in the region
- Changes in commodity prices that improve project economics
- Potential government policy changes or funding programs supporting regional water infrastructure

MITEZ continues to advocate for regional water infrastructure and maintains the Cave Hill Dam as a priority project for future consideration. The organization has positioned the project so that it can be advanced quickly should conditions become favorable.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

Environmental impact assessment was conducted as part of the feasibility study process during 2018-2019. The assessments were incorporated into the detailed business case completed in June 2019. However, detailed findings have not been publicly disclosed in available documentation. A full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be required under Queensland legislation if the project were to proceed to the development and approvals phase.

#### Ecosystem Impacts

The Cave Hill Dam would impact the Cloncurry River and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems:

- **River flow regime:** Construction of a 248GL storage would significantly alter the natural flow regime of the Cloncurry River, affecting downstream ecosystems and water users
- **Aquatic ecosystems:** Impacts on river ecology, fish populations, and aquatic biodiversity in the Cloncurry River system
- **Terrestrial habitats:** Inundation of approximately 248GL area would flood terrestrial habitats, affecting flora and fauna
- **Connectivity:** Potential impacts on ecological connectivity along the river corridor

Specific impact assessments have not been publicly detailed in available sources.

#### Water Quality

Potential water quality considerations include:

- Changes in water temperature due to storage
- Sediment management and impacts on downstream sediment loads
- Nutrient dynamics in reservoir and downstream river
- Potential for stratification and water quality issues in reservoir

Detailed water quality assessments would be required as part of any future EIS process.

#### Downstream Effects

The dam is located on the Cloncurry River within the Flinders River catchment, which flows to the Gulf of Carpentaria:

- **Downstream water users:** Impacts on existing water entitlement holders and environmental flows
- **Gulf of Carpentaria:** The Flinders River system flows to the Gulf; changes in flow regime could affect coastal and marine environments
- **Great Barrier Reef:** While the Cloncurry/Flinders system flows to the Gulf of Carpentaria rather than directly to the Great Barrier Reef, cumulative impacts on Gulf ecosystems may have broader marine environment implications

#### Mitigation Strategies

Environmental protection measures have been considered in the feasibility phase, but specific mitigation strategies have not been publicly detailed. If the project proceeds, mitigation would likely include:

- Environmental flow requirements to maintain downstream ecosystem health
- Sediment and erosion control measures
- Fish passage or translocation programs
- Habitat offset or compensation programs
- Water quality monitoring and management
- Adaptive management framework

#### Environmental Benefits

The feasibility study and business case documentation has not publicly claimed specific environmental benefits. Any environmental benefits would need to be assessed against impacts in a comprehensive EIS.

#### Ongoing Monitoring

No environmental monitoring programs are currently in place, as the project has not proceeded beyond feasibility. If constructed, environmental monitoring would be required as a condition of approvals and would likely include:

- Water quality monitoring in reservoir and downstream
- Flow regime monitoring
- Ecological health assessments
- Compliance monitoring against approval conditions

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The Traditional Owners of the Cave Hill Dam project area are the **Mitakoodi and Mayi people**, who are applicants for Native Title in the region. The Cloncurry area sits within the traditional lands of these First Nations groups, who have maintained cultural connections to the land and waterways for tens of thousands of years.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

During the feasibility study phase (2017-2019), the Jacobs consulting team initiated engagement with the Mitakoodi and Mayi people. The approach involved inviting the Traditional Owners to share insights about the cultural significance of the Cave Hill area and the broader Cloncurry River landscape.

A formal cultural heritage assessment, as would be required under Queensland's cultural heritage legislation, has not been completed, as the project has not progressed to the development and approvals stage. Such an assessment would be a mandatory requirement before any construction could commence.

Key elements of cultural heritage in the project area may include:

- **Sacred sites:** Places of spiritual and cultural significance to Mitakoodi and Mayi people
- **Archaeological sites:** Evidence of long-term occupation and use of the area
- **Story places:** Locations connected to cultural narratives and knowledge systems
- **Water resources:** The Cloncurry River itself holds cultural significance as a vital water source and cultural landscape feature

#### Consultation Process

The consultation process initiated during the feasibility phase represented an early-stage engagement approach. The Jacobs team's dialogue with the Mitakoodi and Mayi people aimed to:

- Establish relationships with Traditional Owner representatives
- Understand cultural values and concerns related to the project area
- Identify cultural heritage issues that would need to be addressed in more detail if the project proceeded
- Inform the feasibility study with Traditional Owner perspectives

This initial consultation was appropriate for the feasibility phase but would need to be significantly expanded if the project were to advance. A comprehensive consultation and engagement process would be required, including:

- Formal cultural heritage surveys and assessments
- Ongoing engagement with Traditional Owner organizations
- Negotiation of cultural heritage management protocols
- Potential development of Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs) or similar frameworks

#### Cultural Heritage Concerns

Specific cultural heritage concerns raised by the Mitakoodi and Mayi people have not been publicly documented in available sources. However, typical concerns for a project of this nature might include:

- Impacts on sacred sites that may be inundated by the reservoir
- Disturbance of archaeological sites during construction
- Changes to the cultural landscape and traditional use of the river
- Access to country and cultural practice areas
- Protection of culturally significant species and resources
- Impacts on cultural water values and practices

#### Protection Measures

No formal cultural heritage protection measures have been implemented, as the project has not advanced beyond feasibility. If the project were to proceed, protection measures would be developed through the cultural heritage assessment and consultation process, and would likely include:

- **Cultural heritage surveys:** Comprehensive field surveys to identify and document cultural heritage places
- **Protection of significant sites:** Exclusion zones or design modifications to avoid impacts on significant sites
- **Cultural heritage management plan:** Detailed plan specifying how cultural heritage will be managed throughout construction and operation
- **Monitoring and compliance:** Traditional Owner involvement in monitoring compliance with heritage protections
- **Agreements:** Potential ILUA or cultural heritage agreement negotiated with Traditional Owner groups
- **Capacity building:** Opportunities for Traditional Owner involvement in project implementation, potentially including employment and business opportunities

#### Ongoing Relationship

The relationship with Traditional Owners established during the feasibility phase would need to be maintained and significantly strengthened if the project were to proceed. This would involve:

- Continued dialogue and engagement with Mitakoodi and Mayi representative organizations
- Formal consultation processes as required under legislation
- Partnership approaches that respect Traditional Owner rights and interests
- Incorporation of Traditional Owner knowledge into environmental and water management
- Long-term frameworks for Traditional Owner involvement in project governance and management

### Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

The Cave Hill Dam project has not progressed to the approvals phase, as the detailed business case concluded the project was not economically viable under current conditions. However, comprehensive regulatory approvals would be required if the project were to proceed.

#### Required Approvals

If the Cave Hill Dam project were to advance, the following approvals would likely be required:

**Queensland State Approvals:**

- **Environmental Impact Statement (EIS):** Assessment under the Environmental Protection Act 1994, likely as a coordinated project under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971

- **Water Resource Plan Amendment:** Potential amendments to the Gulf Water Resource Plan to accommodate the new infrastructure and associated water allocations

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The Cave Hill Dam project sits within the **Gulf Water Plan area**, which covers 317,048 square kilometers in far North West Queensland. Specifically, the project is located within the **Flinders River catchment**, the largest catchment in the plan area, covering approximately 109,000 square kilometers.

The Gulf Water Resource Plan has been amended to provide:
- **General unallocated water reserves:** 239,650 megalitres in the Flinders River catchment
- **Indigenous unallocated water reserves:** 8,500 megalitres in the Flinders River catchment

The Cave Hill Dam was conceived as potential infrastructure to enable utilization of these unallocated water reserves for productive purposes, particularly irrigated agriculture and mining sector water supply.

In 2024, the Queensland Government initiated a review of the Gulf Water Plan, responding to concerns that the water plan does not effectively support growth in irrigated agriculture and the emerging critical minerals industry, particularly in the Flinders catchment. This review context may affect the future integration of projects like Cave Hill Dam into regional water planning frameworks.

Water allocation processes in the Flinders catchment have been complex. In response to high demand, 110,000ML of general reserve unallocated water was released for purposes relating to 'rural' or 'any' uses. However, on 14 March 2024, the Department of Resources decided not to progress any tenders or make offers to enter Call Option Deeds, creating uncertainty around water allocation processes in the region.

#### Regional Development

The Cave Hill Dam project is closely aligned with North West Queensland regional development priorities:

**Mount Isa to Townsville Economic Zone (MITEZ):**
MITEZ, a not-for-profit regional economic development organization, has been the primary proponent and advocate for the Cave Hill Dam. The organization views the dam as critical infrastructure to unlock the region's economic potential, particularly in:

- Irrigated agriculture development
- Mining sector expansion
- Regional water security
- Population retention and growth
- Diversification of the regional economy

**Mining Sector Development:**
North West Queensland has a long history of mining, and the region is positioned for significant expansion, particularly in critical minerals. The Cave Hill Dam project was designed to support water requirements for:

- Ernest Henry Mining (copper-gold mine)

**Copperstring 2.0 Connection:**
The 2023 announcement of the Copperstring 2.0 electricity transmission project has created renewed interest in the Cave Hill Dam. Copperstring 2.0 will connect North West Queensland to the National Electricity Market, providing reliable, cost-effective power to support mining development. Cloncurry Mayor Andrew Daniels noted that this infrastructure is expected to unlock billions of dollars in new mining projects, many south of Cloncurry, creating new water demand that could improve the economic case for the Cave Hill Dam.

**Agricultural Development:**
The Cave Hill Dam site is located upstream of more than 70,000 hectares of soils identified as suitable for irrigation. Development of an irrigated agriculture sector in the Cloncurry region represents a potential economic diversification opportunity, moving beyond the region's traditional reliance on mining and pastoral industries.

#### Water Security

**Cloncurry Township:**
Cloncurry's current water supply relies primarily on Lake Julius. The Cave Hill Dam, with a proposed capacity of 248GL (2.1 times the size of Lake Julius), would significantly enhance water security for the township, providing:

- Increased storage capacity and supply reliability
- Resilience against drought and climate variability
- Capacity to support township population growth
- Reduced risk of water restrictions

**Regional Water Supply:**
The broader North West Queensland region faces water security challenges related to:

- High climate variability and periodic drought
- Distance from major water infrastructure
- Growing demand from mining sector
- Limited existing storage infrastructure

The Cave Hill Dam would contribute to regional water security as part of a broader water infrastructure network.

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

The Cave Hill Dam project, while not yet constructed, offers important lessons for water infrastructure development in regional Queensland:

**1. Economic Viability is Critical:**
Despite technical feasibility and strategic alignment with regional goals, the project has not proceeded because costs outweigh benefits under current market conditions. This underscores the importance of rigorous economic analysis and the reality that not all technically feasible projects are economically viable without changed circumstances or policy interventions.

**2. Thorough Feasibility Assessment Matters:**
The comprehensive feasibility study by Jacobs, funded through NWIDF, provided solid technical foundation for future consideration. The $1.765 million investment in understanding the project's viability was prudent, avoiding potentially much larger investments in an unviable project while positioning the region for future opportunities.

**3. Regional Development Requires Integrated Infrastructure:**
The renewed interest following the Copperstring 2.0 announcement demonstrates that major infrastructure projects often require complementary investments. Water infrastructure alone may not be viable, but when integrated with power, transport, and other enabling infrastructure, the combined benefits may justify investment.

**4. Water Demand Must Be Demonstrated:**
The business case identified potential for irrigated agriculture development, but viability depends on demonstrating actual demand and functioning supply chains. Speculative water infrastructure without confirmed demand presents significant risk.

**5. Long-Term Planning Enables Opportunistic Development:**
By completing feasibility work and documenting the project thoroughly, MITEZ has positioned the Cave Hill Dam to be advanced quickly if circumstances change. This "shovel-ready" approach enables regions to respond rapidly to new opportunities or funding programs.

#### Best Practices

**Strong Technical Assessment:**
The engagement of a leading international consultancy (Jacobs) to undertake comprehensive feasibility work, including geotechnical investigations, engineering design, and economic modeling, represents best practice in infrastructure planning.

**Multi-Stakeholder Engagement:**
Early engagement with Traditional Owners (Mitakoodi and Mayi people) during the feasibility phase demonstrated appropriate consultation, though this would need to be significantly expanded if the project proceeds.

**Transparent Business Case Development:**
The conclusion that costs outweigh benefits, rather than pursuing the project regardless, demonstrates appropriate use of evidence in decision-making.

**Strategic Positioning:**
The development of the 2020 Investment Prospectus and maintenance of the project in regional planning demonstrates strategic thinking about how to position infrastructure for future consideration.

#### Challenges

**Economic Viability in Remote Regions:**
The Cave Hill Dam experience highlights the challenge of achieving economic viability for major water infrastructure in remote, sparsely populated regions with uncertain demand.

**Market Conditions and Timing:**
The project's viability is highly dependent on market conditions, commodity prices, and water demand that are beyond local control. This creates uncertainty and difficulty in planning.

**Water Allocation Complexity:**
The broader challenges with Gulf Water Plan and Flinders River water allocation processes (including the 2024 decision not to proceed with tenders) illustrate the complexity of water planning and allocation in the region.

**Long Development Timeframes:**
The project was first investigated in 2017, with feasibility completed in 2019, yet remains unrealized in 2025. Long timeframes between concept and delivery present challenges for regional planning and development.

#### Legacy

**Regional Advocacy:**
The Cave Hill Dam project has become a symbol of regional aspiration for water infrastructure development in North West Queensland. MITEZ's advocacy has kept regional water security and infrastructure on the agenda.

**Technical Knowledge:**
The feasibility work has generated significant technical knowledge about water resources, dam site characteristics, and regional water demand that will inform future planning.

**Future Readiness:**
The completed feasibility work positions the region to respond quickly if circumstances change, whether through new mining developments, agricultural opportunities, or government funding programs.

**Water Planning Discourse:**
The project has contributed to broader discussions about water allocation, irrigated agriculture potential, and water infrastructure in the Gulf region.

#### Comparable Projects

The Cave Hill Dam can be compared to several similar projects:

**Nullinga Dam (Atherton Tablelands):**
Another proposed Queensland water infrastructure project that faced economic viability challenges; demonstrates similar pattern of technically feasible but economically challenging projects in regional areas.

**Urannah Dam (Burdekin):**
Proposed dam in North Queensland that has undergone multiple feasibility studies over decades; shows the long timeframes and changing circumstances affecting major water infrastructure decisions.

**Big Rocks Weir (Central Queensland):**
Water infrastructure project that advanced to construction following thorough feasibility work and government funding commitment; shows the pathway that projects like Cave Hill Dam might follow if circumstances change.

#### Future Implications

**Water Infrastructure Planning:**
The Cave Hill Dam experience will inform future approaches to water infrastructure planning in Queensland, particularly regarding:

- Economic viability assessment methods
- Integration with regional economic development
- Timing and sequencing of complementary infrastructure investments
- Approaches to maintaining "ready to proceed" projects

**Critical Minerals Development:**
As Queensland and Australia focus on critical minerals development, the Cave Hill Dam demonstrates the water infrastructure challenges that may constrain development in remote mineral-rich regions.

**Climate Adaptation:**
In a context of climate change and increasing variability, the Cave Hill Dam represents the type of water security infrastructure that may become more important, even if not currently economically viable.

**Regional Development Policy:**
The project illustrates tensions between regional development aspirations and market-based infrastructure development, potentially informing future regional development policy and government intervention decisions.

**Integrated Planning:**
The connection between Cave Hill Dam viability and the Copperstring 2.0 project demonstrates the need for integrated infrastructure planning that considers water, power, transport, and communications infrastructure together rather than in isolation.
