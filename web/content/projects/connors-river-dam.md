## Detailed Information

### Project Overview

The Connors River Dam and Pipeline Project was a major water infrastructure proposal designed to secure water supplies for the rapidly expanding coal mining industry in Central Queensland. Proposed by SunWater Limited, Queensland's bulk water supply authority, the project comprised construction of a large dam on the Connors River with a storage capacity variously reported as 367,540 megalitres or 373,662 megalitres (sources differ slightly), along with a 130-133 km pipeline capable of delivering 49,500 megalitres per year of high-priority water to mining operations in the Bowen Basin and emerging Galilee Basin coalfields.

The project was conceived in the mid-to-late 2000s during a period of significant coal mining expansion in Central Queensland, when water security emerged as a critical constraint to further development. The coal mining sector required reliable, high-volume water supplies for operations including coal washing, dust suppression, and general operational needs. SunWater positioned the Connors River Dam as part of its "Water for Central Queensland" strategy to meet this growing demand.

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **SunWater Limited:** State-owned corporation serving as project proponent and intended operator
- **Queensland Coordinator-General:** Regulatory authority managing the environmental impact assessment and approval process
- **Commonwealth Department of Environment:** Federal regulatory authority under EPBC Act
- **Central Queensland coal mining companies:** Intended primary customers (Bowen Basin and Galilee Basin operators)
- **Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation:** Traditional Owners of the project area
- **Isaac Regional Council:** Local government authority
- **Queensland Government:** Policy direction and potential co-investment partner
- **Environmental advocacy groups:** Raised concerns about ecosystem impacts

**Scale and Scope:**
With a combined project value of approximately $1.0-1.3 billion, the Connors River Dam would have been one of Queensland's largest water infrastructure investments in the early 2010s. The dam was designed using Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) construction methodology, with Early Contractor Involvement in design and construction planning to optimize cost and construction timeline.

The project represented a significant bet on the continued expansion of Queensland's coal export industry and the development of new coal basins, particularly the Galilee Basin, which required substantial water infrastructure to become viable.

### Project History and Status

#### Initial Conception and Feasibility (Mid-2000s to 2009)

The Connors River Dam project emerged from SunWater's strategic planning for water supply to support Central Queensland's booming coal mining sector in the mid-2000s. As coal prices rose and mining companies sought to expand operations in the Bowen Basin and develop new projects in the Galilee Basin, water security became a critical constraint. Existing water sources were approaching full allocation, and groundwater options were limited or environmentally contentious.

SunWater conducted initial feasibility investigations identifying the Connors River as a suitable location for a large storage facility. The river's hydrology, topography, and proximity to major mining operations made it an attractive option. The business case emphasized that the project could be delivered in parallel with mining sector construction programs, ensuring water availability aligned with mine development schedules.

#### Environmental Impact Assessment (2009-2010)

The project entered formal environmental assessment under Queensland's Coordinator-General process in 2009. SunWater prepared a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement covering:
- Hydrology and water resources
- Aquatic and terrestrial ecology
- Threatened species impacts
- Water quality
- Downstream environmental flows
- Cultural heritage
- Socio-economic impacts
- Alternatives analysis

The EIS process also triggered Commonwealth assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) due to potential impacts on matters of national environmental significance, including threatened species and Great Barrier Reef water quality.

Public consultation was conducted, with submissions received from environmental groups, Traditional Owners, government agencies, and other stakeholders. In response to submissions, SunWater prepared a Supplementary EIS addressing additional concerns and information requests.

The Coordinator-General's evaluation report was completed in February 2010, recommending approval subject to conditions. The Commonwealth Minister for Environment also granted approval of the controlled action, subject to environmental conditions.

#### Design and Pre-Construction Phase (2010-2011)

Following environmental approvals, SunWater advanced detailed engineering design work. In 2010, the project was presented at the Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD) annual conference, with technical papers describing the dam design, construction methodology, and project delivery strategy.

The project was characterized as utilizing Roller Compacted Concrete technology with Early Contractor Involvement to optimize design and construction efficiency. Construction was scheduled to commence in mid-2011, with commissioning targeted for early 2014.

However, as the project approached construction phase, market conditions began to shift. Coal prices peaked in 2011 but began declining. More critically for the project, mining companies' water demand forecasts became increasingly uncertain.

#### Project Cancellation (2012)

In 2012, the Connors River Dam project was cancelled by the Newman LNP Government. The primary stated reason was lack of commercial interest from coal companies. Without firm water purchase commitments from mining operators, the project lacked a viable commercial foundation.

This decision was particularly notable because it was an LNP government cancelling a major resource sector infrastructure project, typically the type of development LNP governments support. The cancellation reflected the challenging economics: construction costs of $1.0-1.3 billion required long-term, high-volume water purchase agreements that mining companies were unwilling or unable to commit to given market uncertainties.

Environmental considerations may also have influenced the decision, as the project faced opposition from conservation groups concerned about river ecosystem impacts and Great Barrier Reef water quality.

#### Post-Cancellation Period (2012-Present)

Since 2012, the Connors River Dam has remained officially discontinued, listed under "Projects discontinued or on hold" on the Queensland Coordinator-General's website. However, the project has periodically re-emerged in political discourse.

Individual LNP politicians, including Senator Matt Canavan and local candidates such as Tracie Newitt (candidate for Mirani), have called for the project to be revived, arguing it remains "shovel-ready" due to completed approvals and could support ongoing mining sector needs. However, these calls have not translated into formal party policy or government commitments.

The project's revival faces significant headwinds:
- Coal industry declining interest as industry faces long-term decarbonization pressures
- Environmental opposition remains strong
- Cost escalation since 2012 would likely increase project costs substantially
- Alternative water supply solutions have been developed
- Political risk of committing large public funds to coal industry infrastructure in climate change era

As of 2024, there are no active plans to revive the Connors River Dam project.

  - Potential: Water sales to agricultural users
  - Potential: Water sales to Nebo township
  - Revenue model failed when mining companies declined to commit to water purchases

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared for the Connors River Dam project and assessed by the Queensland Coordinator-General and Commonwealth Department of Environment. The EIS process included:

- **Main EIS:** Comprehensive assessment covering all environmental aspects
- **Supplementary EIS:** Additional information responding to submission concerns
- **Technical Studies:** Detailed investigations of hydrology, ecology, water quality, threatened species, cultural heritage
- **Public Consultation:** Submissions from environmental groups, government agencies, Traditional Owners, and public
- **Coordinator-General's Report:** Evaluation report completed February 2010 recommending approval with conditions
- **Commonwealth Approval:** EPBC Act approval granted subject to environmental conditions

#### Ecosystem Impacts

The Connors River Dam would have significantly altered the river ecosystem:

**River Hydrology:**
- Major disruption to natural flow regime of Connors River
- Reduced downstream flows affecting river and floodplain ecosystems
- Changes to flow timing, magnitude, duration, and frequency
- Impacts on seasonal flooding patterns critical for ecological processes

**Aquatic Ecosystems:**
- Creation of large reservoir inundating riverine habitat
- Barrier to fish migration and aquatic species movement
- Altered water temperature and dissolved oxygen regimes
- Changes to sediment transport affecting downstream habitats
- Potential for altered aquatic species composition

**Terrestrial Ecosystems:**
- Inundation of riparian vegetation within reservoir footprint
- Loss of habitat for terrestrial species
- Fragmentation of habitat connectivity
- Impacts on threatened and endangered species

**Threatened Species:**
- Potential impacts on threatened flora and fauna species identified in project area
- Habitat loss and modification
- Management requirements specified in approval conditions
- Senator Matt Canavan later stated that "turtles already considered in Connors River Dam approvals," suggesting threatened turtle species were a consideration

#### Water Quality

**Reservoir Water Quality:**
- Water quality in new reservoir requiring management
- Potential for stratification, algal blooms, oxygen depletion
- Release water quality management requirements

**Downstream Water Quality:**
- Altered sediment transport regime
- Changes to nutrient dynamics
- Potential for improved or degraded water quality depending on management

**Fitzroy Basin and Great Barrier Reef:**
The Connors River is part of the Fitzroy River Basin, the largest river catchment flowing to Queensland's eastern coast and the largest basin discharging to the Great Barrier Reef. Environmental concerns included:

- Altered sediment and nutrient flows from the Fitzroy Basin to the Great Barrier Reef
- The Fitzroy Basin already experiences high sediment levels from agricultural land erosion
- Sediments transport nutrients leading to algal blooms
- Metals can bind to sediments and accumulate
- Keppel Bay reefs (approximately 300 km downstream) at risk from sediment, nutrients, and chemicals
- Contribution to cumulative impacts on Great Barrier Reef water quality

#### Downstream Effects

- **Water Availability:** Reduced downstream water availability for other users and environmental flows
- **Fitzroy Basin Water Resource Plan:** Integration with regional water resource planning required
- **Environmental Flows:** Requirements for environmental flow releases to maintain downstream ecosystem health
- **Agricultural Impacts:** Potential positive impacts through supplementary water supply, but also reduced natural flood irrigation

#### Mitigation Strategies

The project approvals included numerous environmental protection requirements:

- **Environmental Management Plans:** Comprehensive plans covering construction and operation
- **Threatened Species Management:** Specific protocols for identified threatened species
- **Water Quality Management:** Monitoring and management requirements
- **Environmental Flow Requirements:** Specified flow release regimes to maintain downstream ecosystems
- **Offsets:** Potential environmental offset requirements for unavoidable impacts
- **Monitoring Programs:** Ongoing environmental monitoring during and after construction

#### Environmental Benefits

Proponents claimed limited environmental benefits:

- Managed environmental water releases potentially more reliable than natural variable flows
- Potential for downstream agricultural supply reducing groundwater extraction pressures
- Water supply enabling more sustainable mining practices compared to unregulated groundwater use

However, environmental groups and independent scientists questioned these claimed benefits, arguing that natural flow variability is ecologically important and that the dam would fundamentally alter the river ecosystem.

#### Ongoing Monitoring

The approval conditions specified extensive ongoing environmental monitoring requirements, including:

- Water quality monitoring (reservoir and downstream)
- Aquatic ecosystem health monitoring
- Threatened species monitoring
- Hydrological monitoring
- Compliance reporting to regulatory authorities

These requirements were never implemented due to project cancellation.

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The Connors River Dam project area is located on the traditional lands of the **Barada Barna people**. Key information about the Traditional Owners:

**Barada Barna People:**
- Traditional lands cover approximately 3,229 km² in Central Queensland
- Boundaries: Connors Range (east), Middlemount (south), Peak Ranges (west), Lake Elphinstone (north)
- Historical records (Norman Tindale) indicate Barada lands stretched over approximately 6,500 km² in the Connors River area from Killarney north to Nebo
- Native title consent determination granted June 2016 (four years after project cancellation)

**Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation (BBAC):**
- Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC) representing Barada Barna people
- Established to manage native title rights and interests
- Active in cultural heritage management, economic development, and community services
- Works with multiple industries operating on Barada Barna country, particularly mining sector

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

As part of the EIS process, cultural heritage assessment was conducted:

**Assessment Process:**
- Cultural heritage studies undertaken as required under Queensland Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act
- Assessment documentation included in EIS appendices
- Identification and mapping of cultural heritage sites within project area
- Assessment of potential impacts on cultural sites and values

**Consultation:**
- Consultation with Traditional Owners and their representatives conducted during planning phase
- Cultural Heritage Management Plan requirements included in approval conditions
- Ongoing consultation protocols specified for project implementation

**Challenges:**
- Limited publicly available detail on specific cultural heritage concerns or findings
- Assessment occurred before formal native title determination (2016)
- Project cancelled before Cultural Heritage Management Plan fully implemented

#### Cultural Heritage Concerns

While specific concerns are not detailed in publicly available documents, typical First Nations concerns for dam projects include:

- **Inundation of Cultural Sites:** Permanent flooding of culturally significant sites within reservoir footprint
- **Disruption to Country:** Fundamental alteration of river systems and landscapes with deep cultural significance
- **Access Impacts:** Reduced access to traditional lands and cultural sites
- **Spiritual and Cultural Values:** Disruption to spiritual connection to Country and river systems
- **Intergenerational Knowledge:** Loss of ability to maintain and transmit cultural knowledge tied to specific places
- **Water Management:** Alteration of natural water flows and cycles with cultural and spiritual significance

The Barada Barna people's views on the Connors River Dam project specifically are not documented in available public sources.

#### Protection Measures

The project approvals included cultural heritage protection requirements:

- **Cultural Heritage Management Plan (CHMP):** Comprehensive plan required under approval conditions
- **Site Protection:** Protocols for protecting identified cultural heritage sites
- **Monitoring and Discovery:** Procedures for managing unexpected cultural heritage discoveries during construction
- **Ongoing Consultation:** Requirements for continued engagement with Traditional Owners
- **Employment and Economic Opportunities:** Potential provisions for Indigenous employment and business opportunities

**Current Cultural Heritage Management:**

Since receiving native title determination in 2016, the Barada Barna people have strengthened their cultural heritage management capabilities:

- **Winnaa Pty Ltd:** Barada Barna's Cultural Heritage arm dedicated to preserving and honoring cultural heritage, offering culturally connected services ensuring protection and respectful management of significant cultural sites and artifacts
- **Traditional Owner Reference Group:** Barada Barna representatives participate in regional natural resource management and cultural heritage protection
- **Industry Partnerships:** BBAC works with mining and other industries to manage cultural heritage on Barada Barna country

These enhanced capabilities were developed after the Connors River Dam project was cancelled and represent a significantly stronger cultural heritage management framework than existed during the project planning phase.

#### Agreements

No formal agreements (such as Indigenous Land Use Agreements) were reached for the Connors River Dam project, as it was cancelled before proceeding to construction. Had the project advanced, a Cultural Heritage Management Plan and potentially broader partnership agreements would have been required.

#### Ongoing Relationship

The cancellation of the project means there is no ongoing relationship between the Traditional Owners and the Connors River Dam project. However, the Barada Barna people continue to manage their traditional lands and work with various industries operating in the region, primarily coal mining companies, through negotiated agreements and cultural heritage management frameworks.

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

**Commercial Viability and Market Risk:**
The Connors River Dam project provides a critical lesson about the importance of firm commercial commitments before proceeding with large-scale infrastructure. Despite completing environmental approvals and detailed design work, the project failed when mining companies declined to commit to long-term water purchases. This highlights:

- **Market Risk Assessment:** Need for robust assessment of customer commitment, not just expressions of interest
- **Commercial Foundations:** Large infrastructure requires firm commercial agreements before proceeding
- **Changing Market Conditions:** Sensitivity to commodity price cycles and industry outlook
- **Risk Allocation:** Questions about appropriate risk sharing between government and private sector

**Environmental Assessment Timing:**
The project underwent extensive and costly environmental assessment, only to be cancelled for commercial reasons. This raises questions about:

- **Front-End Due Diligence:** Should commercial viability be firmly established before expensive environmental assessments?
- **Process Efficiency:** How to balance thorough environmental assessment with commercial risk management
- **Sunk Cost Management:** Avoiding significant public and proponent investment in projects with uncertain commercial foundations

**Industry Transition Risk:**
The project was conceived during a coal boom but cancelled as the industry outlook became uncertain. Key lessons:

- **Long-Term Industry Outlook:** Need to consider long-term industry trends, not just current market conditions
- **Transition Risk:** Major infrastructure with 50-100 year lifespans must account for industry and policy transitions
- **Fossil Fuel Infrastructure:** Growing risk of stranded assets as world transitions to low-carbon economy
- **Climate Policy Integration:** Water infrastructure planning must integrate climate change and decarbonization policies

**Political Risk:**
Ironically, the project was cancelled by an LNP government despite being typically the type of resource sector infrastructure LNP governments support. Lessons include:

- **Bipartisan Support:** Major infrastructure requires support across political spectrum
- **Fiscal Responsibility:** Governments increasingly reluctant to commit public funds to commercially unviable projects
- **Changing Political Priorities:** Political support can shift rapidly based on economic conditions and public sentiment

## Conclusion

The Connors River Dam and Pipeline Project represents a significant "what if" in Queensland water infrastructure history. Valued at $1.0-1.3 billion, the project would have been one of the state's largest water infrastructure investments in the early 21st century, providing secure water supply to the expanding Central Queensland coal mining sector.

Despite completing comprehensive environmental assessments and obtaining all necessary approvals by 2010, the project was cancelled in 2012 by the LNP Newman Government due to insufficient commercial interest from mining companies. This cancellation—of a major resource sector infrastructure project by an LNP government—reflected both the challenging economics of the proposal and the changing outlook for the coal industry.

The project's legacy endures in Queensland water infrastructure planning, highlighting the critical importance of firm commercial foundations, the challenges of single-purpose infrastructure serving volatile industries, and the growing influence of environmental considerations, particularly Great Barrier Reef water quality, in infrastructure decision-making.

As of 2024, the Connors River Dam remains discontinued with no active plans for revival, symbolizing the tensions between resource development, environmental protection, and fiscal responsibility in contemporary infrastructure planning. The project serves as a valuable case study for future water infrastructure proposals, particularly those supporting industries facing long-term transition pressures in a decarbonizing global economy.
