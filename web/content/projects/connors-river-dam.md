## Project Overview

The Connors River Dam and Pipeline Project was proposed by SunWater Limited to secure water supplies for the expanding Central Queensland coal mining sector. The project comprised a Roller Compacted Concrete dam on the Connors River with storage capacity of approximately 367,540 ML, plus a 130 km pipeline capable of delivering 49,500 ML/year to mining operations in the Bowen Basin and emerging Galilee Basin.

The project emerged from SunWater's "Water for Central Queensland" strategy during the mid-to-late 2000s coal boom, when water security was identified as a critical constraint to further mining expansion. Existing water sources were approaching full allocation, and groundwater options were limited or environmentally contentious.

With a combined project value of $1.0-1.3 billion, the Connors River Dam would have been one of Queensland's largest water infrastructure investments. A secondary lateral pipeline (22 km) was also proposed to supply the township of Nebo.

## Project History

SunWater conducted initial feasibility investigations in 2008-2009, identifying the Connors River as suitable for a large storage facility based on hydrology, topography, and proximity to mining operations. The business case emphasised delivery in parallel with mining sector construction programs.

The project entered formal environmental assessment in 2009. A comprehensive EIS was prepared covering hydrology, ecology, water quality, threatened species, and cultural heritage. The process also triggered Commonwealth assessment under the EPBC Act due to potential impacts on matters of national environmental significance, including Great Barrier Reef water quality.

The Coordinator-General's evaluation report was completed in February 2010, recommending approval subject to conditions. Commonwealth approval was also granted. SunWater advanced detailed engineering design and presented the project at the 2010 ANCOLD conference. Construction was scheduled to commence mid-2011 with commissioning targeted for early 2014.

However, coal prices peaked in 2011 and began declining. Mining companies' water demand forecasts became increasingly uncertain. In 2012, the Newman LNP Government cancelled the project due to lack of commercial interest from coal companies. Without firm water purchase commitments, the project lacked a viable commercial foundation—construction costs of $1.0-1.3 billion required long-term agreements that mining companies were unwilling to commit to given market uncertainties.

Since 2012, the project has remained officially discontinued. Individual politicians, including Senator Matt Canavan, have periodically called for revival, arguing the project remains "shovel-ready" due to completed approvals. However, these calls have not translated into government commitments. The project faces significant headwinds including declining coal industry interest, environmental opposition, cost escalation since 2012, and political risk of committing public funds to coal infrastructure in the context of decarbonisation.

## Environmental Considerations

The Connors River is part of the Fitzroy Basin, Queensland's largest river catchment flowing to the coast and the largest basin discharging to the Great Barrier Reef. Environmental concerns centred on several issues.

The dam would have significantly disrupted the natural flow regime of the Connors River, affecting downstream flows and seasonal flooding patterns critical for ecological processes. The creation of a large reservoir would inundate riverine habitat, create a barrier to fish migration, and alter water temperature and dissolved oxygen regimes. Threatened species habitat within the project area was also a concern.

Water quality impacts extended beyond the immediate project area. The Fitzroy Basin already experiences high sediment levels from agricultural land erosion, with sediments transporting nutrients that contribute to algal blooms. Altered sediment and nutrient flows could affect downstream water quality and contribute to cumulative impacts on Great Barrier Reef water quality, particularly for Keppel Bay reefs approximately 300 km downstream.

The project approvals included extensive environmental conditions covering management plans, threatened species protocols, environmental flow requirements, and monitoring programs. These requirements were never implemented due to project cancellation.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area is located on the traditional lands of the Barada Barna people. Cultural heritage assessment was conducted as part of the EIS process, with consultation during the planning phase. The Barada Barna people received native title consent determination in June 2016, four years after project cancellation.

Their traditional lands cover approximately 3,229 km² in Central Queensland, bounded by Connors Range (east), Middlemount (south), Peak Ranges (west), and Lake Elphinstone (north). The Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation now manages cultural heritage through Winnaa Pty Ltd.

Specific cultural heritage concerns from the Barada Barna people regarding the dam project are not documented in available public sources. Had the project proceeded, a Cultural Heritage Management Plan would have been required under approval conditions.

## Regional Context

The project was conceived to support Central Queensland's coal-dependent economy during a period of rapid mining expansion. It was part of SunWater's broader strategy to remove water availability as a barrier to mining investment in the Bowen and Galilee Basins.

The project's cancellation influenced subsequent Queensland water infrastructure planning, contributing to a shift toward smaller-scale, more adaptable projects with diversified purposes. Rookwood Weir, a smaller project on the Fitzroy River system, later proceeded with government funding (construction 2019-2024), while single-purpose megaprojects like Connors River Dam and Urannah Dam (cancelled 2020) failed to advance.
