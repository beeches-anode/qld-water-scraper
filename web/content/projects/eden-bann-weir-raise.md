## Project Overview

The Eden Bann Weir Raise Project proposes a staged increase in the height of the existing Eden Bann Weir on the Fitzroy River in Central Queensland. The existing weir was built in 1994 to RL 14.5m primarily to supply water to the nearby Stanwell Power Station via a 28 km pipeline and pump station. The current weir holds in excess of 26,000 ML at full supply level (some sources indicate up to 35,900 ML).

The project was originally conceived as part of the Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project, which assessed both raising Eden Bann Weir and constructing a new weir at Rookwood. While Rookwood Weir has since been completed (2023), the Eden Bann Weir raise remains a potential future project that could be implemented to increase water storage capacity in the region.

## Key Specifications

- **Current Capacity:** 26,000-35,900 ML at full supply level
- **Current Height:** RL 14.5m (built 1994)
- **Proposed Stage 2 Raise:** RL 18.2m
- **Proposed Stage 3 Addition:** Gates to raise structure to RL 20.2m
- **Location:** Fitzroy River, 62 km north-west of Rockhampton
- **Water Yield:** Part of combined 76,000 ML/year unallocated water capture potential (with Rookwood)
- **Current Primary Use:** Water supply to Stanwell Power Station (24,000 ML annual allocation)
- **Infrastructure Components:** Fish locks and turtle bypass would be required

## Project History and Status

### Early Development (Pre-2010 to 2011)

The concept of raising Eden Bann Weir emerged as part of broader water infrastructure planning for Central Queensland:

1. **Pre-2010:** Feasibility studies and preliminary investigations identified Eden Bann Weir raising as a potential option, with CSIRO listing it as a preferred option for water security
2. **November 2010:** Initial Advice Statement submitted for the Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project
3. **May 6, 2011:** Project declared a Coordinated Project requiring assessment under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971

### Environmental Impact Assessment (2011-2016)

The project underwent comprehensive environmental impact assessment:

1. **2011-2015:** Detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared, including:
   - Cultural heritage assessments
   - Aquatic ecology and fish habitat studies
   - Fitzroy River turtle species management programs
   - Traffic and transport assessments
   - Vegetation and terrestrial ecology assessments

2. **December 2016:** Coordinator-General's Evaluation Report recommended the project proceed subject to conditions
3. **February 2017:** EIS approved with conditions for both Eden Bann Weir raising and Rookwood Weir construction

Key conditions included:
- Provision of fish locks at each weir to allow wildlife passage
- Turtle bypass systems for the endangered Fitzroy River turtle (Rheodytes leukops)
- Habitat offsets for the 942 ha of fish habitat modification (combined impact of both weirs)
- Cultural heritage management plans
- Environmental monitoring programs

### Business Case Development (2017)

**Building Queensland** completed a detailed business case for the Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project in late 2017, in partnership with joint proponents SunWater and the Gladstone Area Water Board.

**Key Findings:**
- Total estimated capital expenditure: $495 million (for both weirs combined)
- Project had potential to capture 76,000 ML/year of unallocated water resources
- Would help meet future residential and industrial water demand in Rockhampton, Gladstone, and the Capricorn Coast
- Could provide lower priority water for agricultural development in lower Fitzroy valley
- For Rookwood Weir component, benefit-cost ratio estimated at 0.6-0.8 (benefits only 60-80% of costs)
- Peak construction workforce: 150 (if both weirs built simultaneously)
- Construction timeline: Two years, with majority of work undertaken over two dry seasons

### Decision to Prioritize Rookwood Weir (2017-2020)

Following the business case assessment:

1. **Post-2017:** The Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project was refocused to prioritize Rookwood Weir construction
2. **Rationale:** Rookwood Weir was determined to be the most effective method of achieving the requisite water yield
3. **Eden Bann Status:** The raising of Eden Bann Weir was deferred as a future option but remains approved with conditions

### Rookwood Weir Proceeds, Eden Bann Deferred (2020-2024)

1. **August 2020:** Rookwood Weir construction commenced
2. **November 2023:** Rookwood Weir construction completed
3. **April 2024:** Weir infrastructure testing finalized
4. **August 2024:** Customers began accessing Rookwood Weir water
5. **2024-2025:** No announcements regarding proceeding with Eden Bann Weir raise

### Current Status (2025)

- **Eden Bann Weir Raise:** Approved but not proceeding at this time. Remains a potential future project
- **Existing Eden Bann Weir:** Continues to operate at current capacity, primarily supplying Stanwell Power Station
- **Approvals:** Valid approvals with conditions from Coordinator-General (2016/2017)
- **Funding:** No funding committed for the raising project
- **Political Support:** No recent government announcements or commitments

## Financial Details

### Estimated Total Cost

**Combined Project Cost:** $495 million (2017 estimate for both Eden Bann Weir raising and Rookwood Weir construction)

**Note:** Separate cost estimates for Eden Bann Weir raising alone have not been made publicly available. The $495 million figure represents the combined capital expenditure for both infrastructure components.

### Funding Status

- **Current Status:** No funding committed
- **Future Funding:** Would require Queensland and/or Australian Government commitment
- **Funding Pathway:** Would likely follow Building Queensland business case framework if reactivated

### Economic Analysis

**Business Case Findings (2017):**
- Combined project had potential to capture 76,000 ML/year unallocated water
- For Rookwood Weir component, BCR estimated at 0.6-0.8 (sub-optimal economic return)
- Economic case likely stronger when considering water security value for Rockhampton, Gladstone, and Capricorn Coast industrial users
- Separate economic analysis for Eden Bann Weir alone not publicly released

**Employment Projections:**
- Peak construction workforce: 150 (if both weirs built simultaneously)
- Construction over two-year period
- Regional economic benefits through construction spending and ongoing water security

**Operating Costs:**
- SunWater operates existing Eden Bann Weir as part of Lower Fitzroy Water Supply Scheme
- Additional operating costs for raised weir would include fish lock operation, turtle bypass maintenance, and environmental monitoring
