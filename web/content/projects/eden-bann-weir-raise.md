title: Eden Bann Weir Raise Project
description: A proposed staged raising of the existing Eden Bann Weir on the Fitzroy River to increase water storage capacity for Central Queensland.
region: Fitzroy Basin
status: planning
estimatedCost: $495 million (combined with Rookwood Weir - Eden Bann component not separately specified)
fundingCommitted: Not committed
fundingSources:
  - To be determined
capacity: 26,000-35,900 ML (current); proposed increase not specified
proposedRaises: Stage 2 to RL 18.2m, Stage 3 with gates to RL 20.2m
location: Fitzroy River, approximately 62 km north-west of Rockhampton
organizations:
  - Gladstone Area Water Board (GAWB) - joint proponent
  - SunWater Limited - joint proponent and operator
  - Building Queensland - business case development
  - Stanwell Corporation - major water customer
environmentalRisks: Fish passage barriers, modification of 942 ha fish habitat (combined with Rookwood), impacts on endangered Fitzroy River turtle and white-throated snapping turtle. Fish locks and turtle bypass required.
approvalsStatus: EIS approved with conditions by Coordinator-General (December 2016/February 2017). Approvals remain valid but project not proceeding.
culturalHeritageIssues: Traditional lands of Darumbal, Gangulu, Kangoulu, Ghungalu, and Jetimarala peoples. Cultural Heritage Management Plan required. Rookwood Weir ILUA signed April 2022 provides model for future engagement.
timeline: Feasibility studies (pre-2010) → Declared Coordinated Project (May 2011) → EIS approved (February 2017) → Rookwood Weir prioritized → Rookwood completed (2023) → Eden Bann remains future option
economicBenefits: Would meet future residential and industrial water demand in Rockhampton, Gladstone and Capricorn Coast. Could provide lower priority water for agricultural development in lower Fitzroy valley.

## Project Overview

The Eden Bann Weir Raise Project proposes a staged increase in the height of the existing Eden Bann Weir on the Fitzroy River. The existing weir was built in 1994 to RL 14.5m, primarily to supply water to Stanwell Power Station via a 28 km pipeline. The current weir holds 26,000-35,900 ML at full supply level.

The project was originally conceived as part of the Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project, which assessed both raising Eden Bann Weir and constructing a new weir at Rookwood. While Rookwood Weir was completed in 2023, the Eden Bann Weir raise remains an approved future option that could be implemented if additional storage capacity is needed.

## Project History

The concept of raising Eden Bann Weir emerged from broader Central Queensland water infrastructure planning. In November 2010, the Initial Advice Statement was submitted for the Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project, and in May 2011 the project was declared a Coordinated Project requiring assessment under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971.

A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was prepared between 2011 and 2015, including cultural heritage assessments, aquatic ecology studies, and species management programs for the endangered Fitzroy River turtle. The Coordinator-General approved the EIS with conditions in December 2016, with final approval in February 2017.

Building Queensland completed a detailed business case in late 2017. The combined project had an estimated capital cost of $495 million and potential to capture 76,000 ML/year of unallocated water. However, the benefit-cost ratio for Rookwood Weir was estimated at only 0.6-0.8. Following this assessment, Rookwood Weir was prioritized as the most effective method of achieving the required water yield, while the Eden Bann raise was deferred.

Rookwood Weir construction commenced in August 2020 and was completed in November 2023. Customers began accessing Rookwood water in August 2024. No announcements have been made regarding proceeding with the Eden Bann Weir raise.

## Environmental Considerations

The EIS identified significant environmental impacts requiring mitigation. Construction would create additional fish passage barriers on the Fitzroy River and, combined with Rookwood Weir, would modify and fragment 942 hectares of fish habitat. The endangered Fitzroy River turtle (Rheodytes leukops) is endemic to the Fitzroy Basin and requires special protection.

Approved conditions require fish locks at each weir to allow wildlife movement, turtle bypass systems, habitat offsets, environmental monitoring programs, and adaptive management frameworks. Species management programs were developed for both the Fitzroy River turtle and white-throated snapping turtle.

The Fitzroy River catchment drains to the Great Barrier Reef, requiring consideration of downstream impacts on sediment and nutrient loads.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area is on the traditional lands of the Darumbal People, Gangulu, Kangoulu, Ghungalu, and Jetimarala peoples. Cultural heritage surveys and assessments were conducted during the EIS process, with Cultural Heritage Management Plans required for construction and operation.

For the related Rookwood Weir project, an Indigenous Land Use Agreement was signed in April 2022 between the Darumbal People Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC, Queensland Government, and SunWater. This agreement provides a model for engagement should the Eden Bann raise proceed.

## Regional Context

The project is part of broader Central Queensland water security planning. It would complement Rookwood Weir and existing water infrastructure to support industrial water users in Rockhampton, Gladstone, and the Capricorn Coast, as well as residential growth and potential agricultural development in the lower Fitzroy valley.

Regional stakeholders including the Central Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils have supported the project. The existing Eden Bann Weir continues to operate at current capacity, primarily supplying Stanwell Power Station's 24,000 ML annual allocation through SunWater's Lower Fitzroy Water Supply Scheme.
