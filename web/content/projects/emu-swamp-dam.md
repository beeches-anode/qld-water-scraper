## Project Overview

The Emu Swamp Dam is a proposed clay-core, rock-faced dam on the Severn River in Queensland's Granite Belt region, coupled with 117-126 kilometres of pipeline distribution network. The project emerged from water security concerns in a high-altitude horticultural region known for wine production, orchards, and vegetable growing that has experienced severe drought conditions.

The project has been controversial due to questions about its economic viability. Independent feasibility studies conducted for Southern Downs Regional Council ranked Emu Swamp Dam 5th out of 7 options for urban water supply and last (7th) for combined urban and irrigation use, concluding that neither option would be economically viable without significant government subsidy.

Federal Water Minister Tanya Plibersek stated in 2023 that "the current feasibility and business case work is insufficient and cost estimates have increased substantially since the initial proposal." The project's cost estimates have escalated from $59-120 million (2016-2017) to $84 million (2019) to approximately $240 million (2023).

## Project History

The Stanthorpe and Granite Belt Chamber of Commerce led initial advocacy for the project, with Granite Belt Water Ltd emerging as the primary proponent. In 2017, Synergies Economic Consulting completed a Business Case Stage 1 assessment examining agricultural and industrial water demand.

On August 3, 2019, Queensland Natural Resources Minister Dr. Anthony Lynham announced a $13.6 million state government commitment, noting that local irrigators and Southern Downs Regional Council had committed $23.4 million. The announcement anticipated federal partnership funding through the National Water Grid initiative.

The project achieved a significant milestone in September 2021 when Granite Belt Water Ltd and four Traditional Owner groups signed a Cultural Heritage Management Plan. Traditional Owners subsequently commenced cultural surveys from Ballendean to Cottonvale.

The trajectory changed following the 2022 federal election. In September 2023, the federal budget deferred $162.5 million in funding, with budget papers noting the project was "not proceeding" and being "reconsidered against alternative options." On April 1, 2023, the Coordinator-General's evaluation report lapsed.

The Queensland Government announced in April 2023 that the project would be assessed as part of the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment, evaluating all water security options for the region rather than assessing the dam proposal in isolation.

## Environmental Considerations

A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was prepared, with documents publicly available through the Queensland State Development website. The EIS found existing surface water quality in the Severn River at the proposed dam site was "indicative of a slightly to moderately disturbed ecosystem, affected by surrounding agricultural development, land clearing, grazing and historic tin mining."

Water quality does not meet prescribed objectives for some nutrients and chemical parameters, with elevated levels of aluminium, zinc, and copper, and dissolved oxygen levels not meeting objectives at times.

A contentious issue has been the vegetated buffer zone width. A 200-metre buffer is required for urban water supply use to meet drinking water quality standards, while a 20-metre buffer was proposed as sufficient for irrigation-only use. The buffer zone requirement directly affects project economics, as the 200m buffer significantly increases land acquisition requirements.

The 223-hectare inundation area includes grazing land, orchards, vineyards, and native vegetation. The Severn River is part of the Murray-Darling Basin system, meaning changes to flow regimes contribute to cumulative impacts on basin hydrology.

## Cultural Heritage

The Cultural Heritage Management Plan signed in September 2021 defines how land use activities can be managed to avoid or minimize harm to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage. The agreement includes provisions for induction programs for construction teams, signage and naming rights to highlight traditional ownership, and Traditional Owner involvement in heritage management.

The four Traditional Owner groups (specific names not disclosed in public sources) have ancestral and ongoing connections to the lands and waters affected by the proposal, including the 223-hectare inundation area and the broader Severn River catchment.

## Regional Context

The project sits within the Border Rivers and Moonie Water Plan area. The proposed extraction of 3,900 ML annually would reduce water available for downstream users and environmental flows within the Murray-Darling Basin.

The community remains divided. Supporters include Granite Belt Water Ltd, approximately 50 local irrigators, and the Stanthorpe and Granite Belt Chamber of Commerce. Opponents include the "Protect Our Water" community group, which cites independent reviews assessing that the project was "neither financially viable nor environmentally sustainable."

The Regional Water Assessment now underway examines alternatives including other dam sites, weirs, groundwater development, demand management, water efficiency measures, recycled water, and pipeline connections to other sources. The project's future depends on whether this assessment identifies Emu Swamp Dam as the optimal solution compared to these alternatives.
