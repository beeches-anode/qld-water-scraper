## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Gilbert River Agricultural Scheme, also known as the Etheridge Irrigation Scheme Project, is a proposed large-scale irrigation development in North Queensland's Gulf Country. Led by Etheridge Shire Council in partnership with Regional Development Australia Tropical North (RDATN), the project aims to unlock the agricultural potential of the Etheridge Shire by utilizing water resources from the Gilbert River catchment.

The project emerged partly as a response to the 2017 suspension of the $2 billion Integrated Food and Energy Development (IFED) project at Georgetown, which was blamed by proponents on the state government's environmental approvals process. Learning from that experience, Etheridge Shire Council established a business arm to pursue a more measured, community-supported approach to developing an irrigated cropping industry.

The Gilbert River catchment contains significant water resources, with CSIRO identifying approximately 495,000 megalitres per annum of available water. The region also contains extensive areas of Class A and B agricultural soils - as much as 530,000 hectares potentially suitable for irrigation development, though current proposals focus on developing 30,000-50,000 hectares initially.

Key stakeholders include:
- **Etheridge Shire Council:** Primary proponent and project coordinator
- **Regional Development Australia Tropical North:** Strategic planning and advocacy partner
- **Far North Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils (FNQROC):** Regional advocacy body seeking Federal funding
- **Ewamian People:** Traditional Owners of the Gilbert River catchment area
- **Local landholders:** Potential participants in the irrigation scheme
- **Queensland and Federal Governments:** Regulatory authorities and potential funding sources

The project fits into broader Northern Australia development priorities, aiming to capitalize on the region's water resources and agricultural potential to drive economic growth and food security.

### Project History and Status

#### Early Concept and Regional Context (pre-2017)

The Etheridge Shire has long been identified as having significant agricultural potential, with extensive areas of quality soils and substantial water resources in the Gilbert River catchment. However, the region's economy has historically been dominated by extensive cattle grazing, with limited irrigation development.

Regional advocacy organizations including FNQROC, RDA Tropical North, and Advance Cairns have identified water infrastructure development as critical for unlocking the agricultural potential of North Queensland.

#### IFED Project and Its Suspension (2017)

In 2017, the $2 billion Integrated Food and Energy Development (IFED) project at Georgetown came to a halt. This private-sector proposal sought to develop one of Australia's largest irrigation schemes in the area. The project's suspension, attributed by proponents to delays in the state government's environmental approvals process, left a gap in plans for agricultural development in the region.

The IFED experience demonstrated both the opportunities and challenges of large-scale agricultural development in the Gulf Country, including environmental assessment requirements, water allocation processes, and community engagement needs.

#### Council-Led Initiative (2017-2019)

Following the IFED suspension, Etheridge Shire Council determined to pursue a council-led approach to irrigation development. The Council established a business arm specifically to help secure funding and develop an irrigated cropping industry using water from the Gilbert River catchment.

This approach aimed to be more measured and community-focused than the previous private-sector proposal, with emphasis on ensuring landholder support and sustainable growth of the agricultural precinct.

In 2019, Far North Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils submitted a proposal to the Federal Treasury seeking $150 million toward a total estimated capital cost of $450 million for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project.

#### Research Investment (2019-2020)

The Federal Government invested $10 million to research cropping opportunities in the Gilbert and Flinders River catchments. This research aimed to identify suitable crops and agricultural practices for the region's tropical savannah environment.

Agricultural forums were held to educate local landholders about diversification options beyond cattle grazing, including cotton, sorghum, grains, pulses, and horticultural crops such as table grapes and mangoes.

#### Business Case Development (2020)

In May 2020, consulting firm Jacobs delivered a detailed business case to Etheridge Shire Council. The business case identified promising opportunities for a large-scale irrigation project and provided technical specifications for water entitlements and infrastructure requirements.

The business case determined that the project was economically feasible and that the area was suited to a range of irrigated crops. As envisaged in the business case, the dam would have capacity to deliver 130 gigalitres of water entitlements per annum, comprising 90 GL of high priority allocations at 95% reliability and 40 GL of medium priority allocations at 85% reliability.

Preliminary economic modelling suggested potential economic benefits of approximately $700 million per annum.

#### Environmental Assessment and Approvals (2021-present)

Following completion of the business case, Council engaged a project manager to guide the project through preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. The EIS is a critical requirement for a project of this scale and will assess potential environmental impacts and identify mitigation measures.

The project requires multiple regulatory approvals covering:
- Water allocation under the Queensland Water Act
- Environmental clearances
- Vegetation management
- Native title future acts
- Cultural heritage protection

The Council has been in liaison with government officials regarding an application to the Northern Australia Water Infrastructure Fund, a Federal Government initiative designed to support irrigation and water infrastructure development in northern Australia.

#### Current Status

As of 2024-2025, the project remains in the planning and approvals phase. Key activities include:
- Preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement
- Ongoing consultation with landholders and stakeholders
- Engagement with Traditional Owners on cultural heritage and ILUA requirements
- Water allocation planning and approvals processes
- Funding applications and advocacy

The project has not yet progressed to detailed design or construction phases, and timeline for these future stages depends on successful completion of approvals and securing of funding.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

An Environmental Impact Statement is currently in preparation for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project. The EIS is a comprehensive assessment process required under Queensland and potentially Federal legislation for projects with significant environmental impacts.

A project manager has been engaged to guide the Council through the EIS process, which will assess potential impacts and identify appropriate mitigation measures. The EIS process includes public consultation and technical studies of environmental values and potential impacts.

#### Ecosystem Impacts

The Gilbert River flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria and supports significant aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Key environmental considerations include:

- **Aquatic ecosystems:** The Gilbert River supports diverse freshwater fish species and other aquatic life. Dam construction and water extraction would alter flow regimes, potentially impacting these ecosystems.

- **Riparian and floodplain ecosystems:** The river's natural flow patterns support floodplain wetlands and riparian vegetation communities. Modified flow regimes could affect these ecosystems.

- **Downstream ecosystems:** The Gulf of Carpentaria receives freshwater flows from the Gilbert and other rivers, supporting marine and estuarine ecosystems including prawn fisheries.

- **Terrestrial impacts:** Irrigation development would require clearing of native vegetation on up to 50,000 hectares, impacting terrestrial fauna and flora.

#### Water Quality

Water quality management is a critical consideration for irrigation development in the tropical Gilbert River catchment:

- **Nutrients and sediments:** Agricultural runoff can contribute nutrients and sediments to waterways, potentially impacting downstream water quality and Gulf ecosystems.

- **Agricultural chemicals:** Use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides in irrigated agriculture requires management to prevent water quality impacts.

- **Salinity:** Irrigation can lead to salinity issues in some circumstances, though the tropical climate and rainfall patterns may moderate this risk.

#### Downstream Effects

The project's water extraction and irrigation development could affect:

- **Downstream water users:** Other water users along the Gilbert River would be affected by altered flow patterns.

- **Gulf of Carpentaria ecosystems:** Reduced freshwater flows to the Gulf could affect estuarine and marine ecosystems, including important prawn fisheries.

- **Great Barrier Reef:** While the Gilbert River flows to the Gulf rather than the Great Barrier Reef, regional water quality is interconnected with broader marine environmental health.

#### Mitigation Strategies

The project proposal emphasizes implementation of best practice agricultural management:

- Environmental Impact Statement to identify impacts and mitigation measures
- Water allocation framework to maintain environmental flows
- Best practice land management protocols for the irrigation precinct
- Vegetation management approvals and offsets for cleared land
- Water quality monitoring and management plans
- Compliance with environmental conditions in approvals

#### Environmental Benefits

Proponents suggest potential environmental benefits including:

- Opportunity to demonstrate best practice irrigation management in tropical environment
- Potentially improved land management compared to some extensive grazing practices
- Regulated water allocation providing framework for environmental protection

#### Ongoing Monitoring

The project would require ongoing environmental monitoring including:

- Water quality monitoring in the Gilbert River and irrigation areas
- Ecological monitoring of river and downstream ecosystems
- Compliance monitoring with environmental approval conditions
- Reporting to regulatory authorities

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The **Ewamian People** are the Traditional Owners of the lands and waters in the Gilbert River catchment area where this project is proposed. The Ewamian People's traditional country extends over an area of north-western Queensland covering the Gilbert and Einasleigh River catchment areas, including Georgetown, Mount Surprise, Forsayth, and Einasleigh.

In 2004, native title was determined in favor of the Ewamian People over more than 2.9 million hectares. As part of the native title determination, the Ewamian people surrendered native title over the far northern Queensland townships of Einasleigh, Forsayth, Mt Surprise, and Georgetown. In return, they received access to their traditional country through three reserves along with land and housing in Georgetown.

Etheridge Shire Council also respectfully acknowledges the **Tagalaka** and **Gugu Badhun** People as traditional custodians of lands within Etheridge Shire.

The **Ewamian Aboriginal Corporation** (Ewamian Limited) represents the Ewamian People and has been successful in negotiating numerous major agreements and Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs) with various parties, including Etheridge Shire Council, resulting in significant compensation, protection of cultural heritage, and other benefits for Ewamian People.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

The project proposal recognizes that appropriate cultural heritage assessment and management is required. The project will need to:

- Conduct cultural heritage surveys to identify sites and values in the project area
- Assess significance of any identified cultural heritage
- Develop appropriate protection and management measures
- Comply with cultural heritage legislation and approval requirements

The area has deep cultural significance to the Ewamian People, with evidence of long occupation and connection to country. The old Gilberton township, for example, lies within what was Ewamian land, and when miners established the township in the 1870s, Ewamian People fought against the new settlement. After years of continual conflict, the Gilberton township was abandoned in 1873.

#### Consultation Process

The project proposal emphasizes establishing appropriate consultation frameworks with Traditional Owners:

- The project aims to establish protocols on a regional basis covering native title future acts and cultural heritage
- Consultation with Ewamian Aboriginal Corporation and other relevant Traditional Owner groups
- Engagement on project design, impacts, benefits, and mitigation measures
- Negotiation of Indigenous Land Use Agreements

The Council's stated approach focuses on sustainable development with community support, which would necessitate meaningful engagement with Traditional Owners as key stakeholders.

#### Cultural Heritage Concerns

While specific concerns have not been publicly detailed, typical cultural heritage considerations for a project of this scale would include:

- Protection of cultural heritage sites (ceremonial sites, artifact scatters, scarred trees, etc.)
- Impacts on cultural landscapes and connection to country
- Access to country for cultural practices
- Water and its cultural significance
- Appropriate decision-making and consent processes
- Sharing of project benefits with Traditional Owners

#### Protection Measures

Protection measures being developed or required include:

- Cultural heritage management plans
- Indigenous Land Use Agreements negotiated with Traditional Owner groups
- Compliance with cultural heritage legislation
- Protocols for managing any cultural heritage discoveries during project implementation
- Ongoing relationship management with Traditional Owners

#### Agreements

The Ewamian People, through Ewamian Limited, have demonstrated capacity to negotiate significant agreements including ILUAs with Etheridge Shire Council for various projects. The Gilbert River project would require negotiation of appropriate agreements covering:

- Native title future acts
- Cultural heritage management
- Project participation and economic benefits
- Employment and training opportunities
- Ongoing consultation and relationship management

#### Ongoing Relationship

The project proposal specifically mentions providing "wide ranging and lasting indigenous economic participation, training and employment opportunities." This suggests intent to create ongoing relationships and benefits beyond initial construction, including:

- Employment opportunities in construction and operations
- Training and skills development
- Business opportunities in the agricultural precinct
- Participation in project governance or oversight

- **Environmental Assessment:** Demonstrating acceptable environmental outcomes for a major water infrastructure development
- **Market Access:** Distance from markets and need for supporting infrastructure
- **Climate Variability:** Managing water security in a region with high rainfall variability
- **Economic Viability:** Ensuring agricultural enterprises can be profitable given production costs and market distances

#### Legacy

The project's legacy, whether ultimately constructed or not, includes:

- Detailed business case and technical assessment of irrigation potential in the Gilbert catchment
- Model for council-led water infrastructure development
- Contribution to understanding of environmental values and sensitivities in the Gulf region
- Advancement of consultation and partnership approaches with Traditional Owners
- Demonstration of regional advocacy and partnership (FNQROC, RDA TN)

If constructed, the project would represent a significant milestone in Northern Australia development and Gulf Country agricultural intensification.

#### Comparable Projects

The Gilbert River scheme can be compared to other water infrastructure proposals in Northern Australia:

- **IFED project (Georgetown):** The suspended $2 billion private-sector proposal that preceded the Council-led initiative
- **Hells Gates Dam (Burdekin):** Another major North Queensland irrigation infrastructure proposal
- **Ord River Irrigation Scheme (WA):** Comparable large-scale irrigation development in Northern Australia with lessons on environmental management and economic outcomes
- **Other Gulf proposals:** Various water infrastructure concepts in the Gulf region with similar objectives of unlocking agricultural potential

#### Future Implications

The project has implications for future water infrastructure planning:

- **Northern Australia development:** Demonstrates pathways and challenges for Northern Australia water resource development
- **Local government roles:** Potential model for council-led infrastructure development
- **Environmental assessment:** Sets precedents for environmental assessment of Gulf region water projects
- **Traditional Owner engagement:** Advances practice in consultation and partnership with Traditional Owners
- **Policy frameworks:** Informs Federal and State policy on supporting regional water infrastructure
- **Agricultural development:** Contributes to understanding of irrigation agriculture potential in Gulf Country

The project's progression through planning and approvals will provide valuable lessons for future water infrastructure proposals in Northern Queensland and Northern Australia more broadly, regardless of whether it ultimately proceeds to construction.
