## Project Overview

The Gilbert River Agricultural Scheme is a proposed large-scale irrigation development in North Queensland's Gulf Country, led by Etheridge Shire Council in partnership with Regional Development Australia Tropical North. The project aims to unlock agricultural potential by utilizing water resources from the Gilbert River catchment, which CSIRO has identified as containing approximately 495,000 megalitres per annum of available water.

The project emerged following the 2017 suspension of the $2 billion Integrated Food and Energy Development (IFED) project at Georgetown, which proponents attributed to delays in the state government's environmental approvals process. Learning from that experience, Etheridge Shire Council established a business arm to pursue a more measured, community-supported approach to developing an irrigated cropping industry.

The region contains extensive areas of Class A and B agricultural soils suitable for irrigation. While up to 530,000 hectares may be potentially irrigable, current proposals focus on developing 30,000-50,000 hectares initially, representing a significant but staged approach to agricultural expansion in the Gulf Country.

## Project History

The Etheridge Shire has long been identified as having significant agricultural potential, though the regional economy has historically been dominated by extensive cattle grazing with limited irrigation development. Regional advocacy organizations including FNQROC, RDA Tropical North, and Advance Cairns have consistently identified water infrastructure development as critical for unlocking North Queensland's agricultural potential.

The 2017 suspension of the IFED project created both a setback and an opportunity. Etheridge Shire Council determined to pursue a council-led approach, establishing a business arm specifically to help secure funding and develop an irrigated cropping industry. This approach aimed to be more measured and community-focused, with emphasis on ensuring landholder support and sustainable growth.

In 2019, Far North Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils submitted a proposal to Federal Treasury seeking $150 million toward the estimated $450 million capital cost. That same year, the Federal Government invested $10 million to research cropping opportunities in the Gilbert and Flinders River catchments, with agricultural forums held to educate local landholders about diversification options.

In May 2020, consulting firm Jacobs delivered a detailed business case determining the project economically feasible. The business case specified that a dam would deliver 130 gigalitres of water entitlements per annum, with preliminary modelling suggesting potential economic benefits of approximately $700 million per annum.

Following completion of the business case, Council engaged a project manager to guide preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. The EIS remains in preparation, with the project requiring multiple regulatory approvals covering water allocation, environmental clearances, vegetation management, native title future acts, and cultural heritage protection.

## Environmental Considerations

The Gilbert River flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria and supports significant aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Key environmental considerations include impacts on freshwater fish species and other aquatic life from altered flow regimes, effects on floodplain wetlands and riparian vegetation communities, and potential downstream impacts on Gulf ecosystems including prawn fisheries.

Water quality management presents particular challenges for irrigation development in the tropical catchment, including management of agricultural runoff (nutrients, sediments, and agricultural chemicals) to prevent water quality impacts on downstream ecosystems.

An Environmental Impact Statement is currently in preparation and will assess potential impacts and identify appropriate mitigation measures. The project proposal emphasizes implementation of best practice agricultural management, with water allocation frameworks designed to maintain environmental flows.

## Cultural Heritage

The Ewamian People are the Traditional Owners of the lands and waters in the Gilbert River catchment. Their traditional country extends over north-western Queensland covering the Gilbert and Einasleigh River catchment areas. In 2004, native title was determined in favor of the Ewamian People over more than 2.9 million hectares.

The Ewamian Aboriginal Corporation (Ewamian Limited) represents the Ewamian People and has successfully negotiated numerous Indigenous Land Use Agreements with various parties, including Etheridge Shire Council. The Gilbert River project will require negotiation of appropriate agreements covering native title future acts, cultural heritage management, and project participation.

Etheridge Shire Council also acknowledges the Tagalaka and Gugu Badhun People as traditional custodians of lands within the Shire. The project proposal specifically mentions providing "wide ranging and lasting indigenous economic participation, training and employment opportunities."

## Regional Context

The project is positioned as a cornerstone of regional economic development, offering diversification from cattle grazing to intensive irrigated agriculture. Regional advocacy organizations have identified this as one of four critical water infrastructure initiatives for North Queensland's agricultural development.

The project aligns with Federal Government Northern Australia development priorities and represents an alternative pathway following the IFED suspension. The council-led approach differs from the previous private-sector proposal by emphasizing community engagement and landholder participation rather than a top-down development model.
