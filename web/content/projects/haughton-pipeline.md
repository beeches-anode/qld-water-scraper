## Project Overview

The Haughton Pipeline is one of Townsville's most significant water infrastructure investments, designed to address the city's long-standing vulnerability to rainfall variability. The project connects the reliable Burdekin River system to Ross River Dam, enabling water transfer during drought conditions to "top up" the dam's 250,000 megalitre capacity.

The project emerged from the Townsville City Deal, Australia's first City Deal signed in 2016. This 15-year partnership between the Australian Government, Queensland Government, and Townsville City Council identified water security as critical infrastructure for transforming the city's economy. The pipeline consists of two stages totalling approximately 64 kilometres of 1.8-metre diameter GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic) Flowtite pipes.

## Project History

Stage 1 construction commenced in 2017, involving installation of 2,763 individual pipe sections across 36 kilometres from the Haughton River to Ross River Dam. The Queensland Government committed $215 million to this first stage, which was completed in June 2020 and included construction of the Haughton Pump Station and Haughton River crossing infrastructure.

Following Stage 1 completion, Stage 2 planning progressed to extend the pipeline 28 kilometres to the Burdekin River near Clare. The design tender was awarded in November 2020, with a total Stage 2 budget of $274 million ($195 million from Queensland Government, $79 million from Townsville City Council).

In early 2023, significant budget challenges emerged when costs escalated to approximately $420 million—a $146 million overrun (53% increase) primarily attributed to post-COVID construction cost escalation. Council publicly acknowledged in July 2024 that it cannot contribute additional funds beyond its $79 million commitment, with discussions ongoing with the Queensland Government regarding funding solutions.

Stage 2 construction commenced in October 2023. By May 2024, more than 3 kilometres of pipe were being installed monthly, and by August 2024, 30% of Stage 2 was complete. The original 2024 completion target has been revised to 2025.

## Environmental Considerations

The project underwent comprehensive environmental assessment at both state and federal levels. Commonwealth EPBC approval was obtained in February 2023 following completion of all bore drilling, ground surveys, and environmental survey work.

Key environmental considerations included vegetation clearing along the 28.5-kilometre greenfield pipeline route, construction of approximately 6 kilometres of access roads, and engineering for river crossings designed to minimise ecosystem disruption. The project operates within the Burdekin Basin which flows to the Great Barrier Reef, requiring assessment of extraction impacts on downstream flows.

## Cultural Heritage

Bindal Traditional Owners, represented by the Bindal Aboriginal Corporation, hold cultural connection to the lands crossed by the pipeline route. In December 2021, Traditional Owners undertook a comprehensive cultural heritage survey, walking the entire 28-kilometre Stage 2 route.

Elder Eddie Smallwood stated: "The cultural heritage survey and monitoring undertaken along the route of the pipeline ensured cultural respect was maintained and gave traditional owners an opportunity to get back on country."

A Cultural Heritage Management Agreement was negotiated and signed, then recommitted in December 2022. This agreement establishes the framework for cultural heritage protection throughout the project, defines roles and responsibilities, provides for Traditional Owner participation in monitoring, and sets protocols for unexpected discoveries.

## Regional Context

Townsville, as North Queensland's largest city, relies primarily on Ross River Dam for water supply. The region experiences high rainfall variability, and previous water restrictions highlighted the city's vulnerability. The Haughton Pipeline provides access to the more reliable Burdekin River system, enabling transfer of 273+ megalitres per day with future expansion capacity to 364 megalitres per day.

The project supports Townsville's role as a hub for resources, defence, education, and health sectors, providing water security essential for population growth and industrial development. Stage 1 remains fully operational while Stage 2 construction continues.
