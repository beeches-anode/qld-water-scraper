## Project Overview

The Hells Gates Dam and Irrigation Scheme was a proposed major water infrastructure project in North Queensland. The project envisioned a 2,100 gigalitre capacity dam on the Upper Burdekin River, approximately 120-160 km northwest of Townsville, paired with downstream irrigation infrastructure to support up to 60,000 hectares of agricultural land.

## Key Specifications

- **Dam Capacity:** 2,100 GL
- **Irrigation Area:** 60,000 hectares (some sources indicate 50,000 Ha)
- **Location:** Upper Burdekin catchment
- **Downstream Infrastructure:** Three irrigation weirs plus Big Rocks Weir
- **Additional Features:** Potential for pumped hydro energy storage

## Project History and Status

### Development Phase (2017-2022)

The project gained momentum through several phases:

1. **2017:** Initial feasibility studies and opportunity overview completed
2. **2019-2022:** Detailed business case development led by SMEC
3. **March 2022:** Morrison Government announced $5.4 billion in conditional funding
4. **May 2022:** Detailed business case submitted to State and Federal Governments

The detailed business case included:
- Preliminary geotechnical assessments
- Cultural heritage assessments
- Construction proposals
- Enhanced economic modelling
- Environmental and social impact assessments
- Engineering investigations

### Discontinuation (2022-2023)

Following a change in federal government:

1. Albanese Government deferred the project for 12 months
2. After only six months, the project was discontinued
3. Business case review determined the dam was "not deliverable"
4. Review identified potential for significant environmental and First Nations cultural impacts
5. Funding was subsequently withdrawn

### Current Status

- **Hells Gates Dam:** Discontinued, will not proceed
- **Big Rocks Weir:** Proceeding separately with Australian Government commitment

## Financial Details

**Estimated Total Cost:** $5.4 billion (2022 estimate; earlier estimates ~$4 billion)

**Funding Status:**
- $5.4 billion conditionally committed by Morrison Government (March 2022)
- Funding was subject to completion of business case and regulatory approvals
- Funding withdrawn after project discontinuation (2023)

**Economic Impact Projections:**
- 7,000+ jobs during construction
- $1.3 billion injection into North Queensland Gross Regional Product
- Long-term agricultural export opportunities
- Sustainable electricity generation through pumped hydro storage

## Environmental Considerations

### Environmental Claims

Project proponents claimed potential environmental benefits:
- Reduced sediment and nutrient loads to downstream Burdekin Falls Dam
- Improved water quality outcomes for Great Barrier Reef through world-leading land management practices
- Enhanced agricultural productivity with reduced environmental footprint

### Environmental Concerns

The business case review identified:
- Significant environmental impacts that contributed to the "not deliverable" determination
- Concerns about ecosystem impacts in the Upper Burdekin catchment
- Potential downstream impacts despite claimed mitigation measures
- Complex interactions with Great Barrier Reef catchment management

## First Nations Cultural Heritage

### Traditional Owners

The project area is on the traditional lands of:
- **Gugu Badhun Aboriginal Corporation**
- **Ngrragoonda Aboriginal Corporation**

### Consultation Process

- Framework for cultural heritage engagement developed
- Presentation to North Queensland Land Council on behalf of Traditional Owner groups
- Detailed cultural heritage assessments included in business case

### Cultural Heritage Concerns

- Both Traditional Owner corporations expressed significant concerns
- Expected loss of cultural heritage in the proposed inundation area
- Further studies required under Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act Qld 2003
- Cultural heritage impacts identified as a key factor in project discontinuation

## Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

### Required Approvals

- Water allocation approval under Burdekin Water Plan
- Environmental impact assessments (State and Federal)
- Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act Qld 2003 compliance
- Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considerations
- Multiple engineering and safety certifications

### Regulatory Outcome

- Detailed business case review (2022) found project "not deliverable"
- Determination based on environmental and cultural impact concerns
- No formal approvals granted before project discontinuation
- Big Rocks Weir component separated and proceeding independently

## Regional Context

### Water Plan Integration

The project required updates to the **Burdekin Water Plan** to incorporate the Hells Gates Dam allocation framework. The current Burdekin Basin water plan did not include provisions for this scale of infrastructure.

### Regional Development

North Queensland stakeholders, including Townsville Enterprise and local government, strongly supported the project for:
- Regional economic diversification
- Agricultural sector expansion
- Water security for Townsville and surrounding areas
- Employment opportunities in regional areas

## Lessons and Legacy

The Hells Gates Dam project represents a case study in:
- Large-scale water infrastructure assessment processes
- Balancing economic development with environmental protection
- Meaningful engagement with Traditional Owners and cultural heritage protection
- The importance of comprehensive business case analysis
- Political considerations in major infrastructure decisions

The Big Rocks Weir component continues as a separate, smaller-scale project that addresses some regional water needs without the environmental and cultural impacts associated with the larger dam proposal.
