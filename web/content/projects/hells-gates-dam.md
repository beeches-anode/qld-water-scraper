## Project Overview

The Hells Gates Dam and Irrigation Scheme was a proposed major water infrastructure project in North Queensland. The project envisioned a dam on the Upper Burdekin River paired with downstream irrigation infrastructure including three irrigation weirs plus Big Rocks Weir, with potential for pumped hydro energy storage.

The project was championed by regional stakeholders including Townsville Enterprise and local government as a means of regional economic diversification, agricultural sector expansion, and water security for Townsville and surrounding areas.

## Project History

Initial feasibility studies and an opportunity overview were completed in 2017. Between 2019 and 2022, SMEC led detailed business case development that included preliminary geotechnical assessments, cultural heritage assessments, construction proposals, enhanced economic modelling, environmental and social impact assessments, and engineering investigations.

In March 2022, the Morrison Government announced $5.4 billion in conditional funding, with the detailed business case submitted to State and Federal Governments in May 2022.

Following a change in federal government, the Albanese Government initially deferred the project for 12 months. After only six months, the project was discontinued when the business case review determined the dam was "not deliverable" due to potential for significant environmental and First Nations cultural impacts. Funding was subsequently withdrawn.

The Big Rocks Weir component has been separated and is proceeding independently with Australian Government commitment.

## Environmental Considerations

Project proponents claimed potential environmental benefits through reduced sediment and nutrient loads to downstream Burdekin Falls Dam and improved water quality outcomes for the Great Barrier Reef through world-leading land management practices.

However, the business case review identified significant environmental impacts that contributed to the "not deliverable" determination, including concerns about ecosystem impacts in the Upper Burdekin catchment and potential downstream impacts on the Great Barrier Reef catchment.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area is on the traditional lands of the Gugu Badhun and Ngrragoonda peoples. Both Traditional Owner corporations expressed significant concerns about expected loss of cultural heritage in the proposed inundation area.

A framework for cultural heritage engagement was developed, including presentation to the North Queensland Land Council on behalf of Traditional Owner groups and detailed cultural heritage assessments in the business case. Further studies were required under the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act Qld 2003. Cultural heritage impacts were identified as a key factor in the project's discontinuation.

## Regional Context

The project required updates to the Burdekin Water Plan to incorporate the Hells Gates Dam allocation framework, as the current plan did not include provisions for infrastructure of this scale.
