## Project Overview

The Hughenden Irrigation Project (HIPCo) proposes an off-stream storage dam on Saego Station that would capture water from Stewart and Jones Valley Creeks directly, and via a diversion weir on the Flinders River at Alderley Crossing. The project aims to transform the agricultural capacity of North-West Queensland's Flinders Shire (population approximately 1,400) by enabling high-value horticulture and fodder production in a region currently dominated by pastoral grazing.

The dam design utilizes natural basalt plateaus at the site, with a 7,650-metre earth embankment wall standing 20.5 metres high. The Australian Government committed $10 million through the National Water Grid Fund for a detailed business case, which was completed in May 2022 as a 1,500+ page document. The business case found a benefit-cost ratio of 1.09 at 7% discount rate.

## Project History

HIPCo was established as a private proponent organization to advance the project through feasibility and planning phases. Initial feasibility work was conducted by Engeny, followed by the $10 million detailed business case submitted to Infrastructure Australia in 2022.

The Australian Government had indicated a construction funding commitment of $170-182 million. However, the 2024 Federal Budget deferred this funding, with government citing the need for "responsible investment in water infrastructure" and "scientific evidence and business cases that stack up economically and environmentally." HIPCo Chair Jeff Reid stated: "We'd spent $10m on a detailed business case, and the next round is about pre-construction planning - an environmental impact statement, the design and so on - that would be $28m in total."

In April 2024, HIPCo's water allocation tender was terminated following the Queensland Government's decision to bring forward a $4 million Regional Water Assessment and Gulf Water Plan review. Despite this setback, HIPCo secured three years of state government funding for continued planning activities.

## Environmental Considerations

The Environmental Flow Review Report (Appendix L of the business case) found that the Saego Dam model meets only 4 of 7 Gulf Water Plan Environmental Flow Objectives. This partial compliance is central to the project's current regulatory challenges, as the water tender termination and accelerated Gulf Water Plan review directly address these environmental flow concerns.

The Flinders River flows to the Gulf of Carpentaria and supports aquatic biodiversity, riparian vegetation, and wetland ecosystems dependent on flood pulses. Key environmental concerns include reduced downstream flows, altered flood pulse timing, impacts on fish passage, and cumulative effects with other water extraction in Gulf catchments.

The Environmental Impact Statement process has not commenced and is estimated to cost $28 million as part of pre-construction planning.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area lies within the traditional lands of the Yirandali (also spelled Jirandali) people, whose language region encompasses Hughenden, the Flinders River, Dutton River, and surrounding areas. The Flinders River holds spiritual significance in Dreamtime stories and represents deep cultural connection for Traditional Owners.

Publicly available sources do not document whether formal cultural heritage assessments have been conducted for the HIPCo project area, the status of consultation with Yirandali Traditional Owner organizations, or Traditional Owner perspectives on the project. Cultural heritage surveys and consultation will be required as part of the EIS and approval processes if the project advances.

## Regional Context

HIPCo is one of several water infrastructure projects assessed under the National Water Grid program and was originally overseen by the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority before transitioning to National Water Grid Authority oversight. The project is often mentioned alongside Hell's Gates Dam as a North Queensland water infrastructure priority.

The project's viability depends fundamentally on outcomes of the Gulf Water Plan review, which will determine whether water can be allocated to new projects while meeting environmental flow objectives. HIPCo has committed to updating its business case to align with review outcomes.

Strong local support exists from Flinders Shire Council and regional stakeholders, with frustration expressed over funding delays and regulatory processes. Political support has come from regional representatives including Katter's Australian Party and LNP members, while both federal and state governments have maintained conditional support contingent on environmental and economic assessments.
