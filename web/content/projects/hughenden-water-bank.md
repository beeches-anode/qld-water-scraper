- **Storage Type:** Off-stream water storage (water bank)
- **Infrastructure Components:**
  - Off-stream storage facility
  - Pumping infrastructure
  - Approximately 7 km of pipeline
  - Distribution system for irrigation supply
- **Water Source:** Flinders River
- **Service Area:** Hughenden and surrounding Flinders Shire agricultural lands
- **Primary Beneficiaries:** 4-5 high-value horticultural farms, 15 Mile Horticulture Project
- **Irrigation Support:** Designed to enable expansion of irrigated agriculture including table grapes, citrus, and other horticultural crops

## Project History and Status

### Pre-Development and Planning (pre-2022)

Flinders Shire Council identified water security as the critical constraint to achieving regional economic development and population growth objectives. The Council developed the "Flinders Water Strategy," which aimed to secure water licenses and establish infrastructure to capture and store water from the Flinders River.

Key planning activities included:
- Securing 8,200 megalitres of river licenses from the Queensland Government
- Developing business case for the off-stream water storage project
- Economic analysis demonstrating BCR of 1.09 and NPV of $5.0 million (at 7% discount rate)
- Designation of the 15 Mile Horticulture Project (918 hectares) as a State coordinated project
- Integration with broader regional development vision: "1,000 jobs in 1,000 days"

### State Funding and Early Progress (2022)

**June 2022:** Queensland Government announced $25.6 million in funding for the Hughenden Water Bank project as part of the 2022-23 State Budget, which invested a record $510 million in water infrastructure across Queensland.

The announcement represented a major milestone for Flinders Shire Council. Mayor Jane McNamara stated that the funding would help materialize Council's vision and continue the expansion of horticultural projects in the Flinders Shire, enabling an additional 4-5 high-value horticultural farms to be developed.

**Late 2022:** The project progressed to its expressions of interest phase, with Council describing the project as "shovel ready." The 8,200 megalitres of river licences granted to the Council was more than sufficient to complete the 7,000 megalitre first stage.

### Federal Funding Challenges (2022-2023)

Council sought matching federal funding of $25.6 million to complete the project financing. However, the federal application encountered significant challenges:

- **Late 2022:** Council expected to receive the result of the Commonwealth funding application but could not enter into contracts with contractors without federal funding confirmation
- **2023:** Federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek indicated that the project needed to expand its list of commercial beneficiaries to qualify for federal support
- **Key Issue:** The project was unable to attract required federal government funding due to the limited number of commercial beneficiaries, a fundamental challenge for a regional project serving a small population base

### Collaborative Regional Approach (2024)

**2024:** Recognizing the challenges of securing federal funding independently, Flinders Shire Council and the Hughenden Irrigation Project Corporation (HIPCo) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on collaborative water harvesting undertakings.

The collaborative approach aims to:
- Research and advocate for optimal economic and community outcomes in harvesting and utilizing Flinders River water resources
- Develop a unified regional water strategy that could demonstrate broader benefits and attract federal support
- Leverage the combined scale and scope of Council's Water Bank project and HIPCo's larger Irrigation Scheme proposal

### Current Status (2024-2025)

The project remains in planning status with the following key elements:
- **State Funding:** $25.6 million secured from Queensland Government
- **Federal Funding:** Not secured; project advocates continuing engagement with federal government
- **Water Licenses:** 8,200 ML secured
- **Approach:** Collaborative regional water strategy with HIPCo
- **Challenges:** Limited commercial beneficiaries constraining federal funding eligibility
- **Opportunity:** Potential to proceed with state funding alone or as part of broader regional water infrastructure initiative

## Financial Details

### Project Cost and Funding

**Estimated Total Cost:** $25.6 million (State-funded component; full project cost with federal contribution would be approximately $51 million)

**Funding Secured:**
- $25.6 million from Queensland Government (2022-23 State Budget)
- Funding released subject to completion of assessments and business case submission

**Funding Sought (Not Secured):**
- $25.6 million matching federal funding (application unsuccessful as of 2024)

### Economic Analysis

**Net Present Value (NPV):** $5.0 million (at 7% real discount rate)

**Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR):** 1.09 (returns $1.33 for every dollar invested)

The economic analysis indicates positive but modest returns, with benefits marginally exceeding costs. This BCR reflects the challenge of infrastructure projects serving small regional populations, where the per-capita benefits may be high but total quantified benefits are constrained by limited commercial scale.

### Economic Impact Projections

- **Jobs Creation:** Supports Council's "1,000 jobs in 1,000 days" vision
- **Agricultural Development:** Enables 4-5 additional high-value horticultural farms
- **15 Mile Horticulture Project:** Critical enabling infrastructure for 918-hectare coordinated project
- **Population Growth:** Supports goal to double Shire population from 1,500 to 3,000 by 2030
- **Regional Development:** Establishes foundation for Hughenden as horticultural hub in North-West Queensland
- **Irrigation Expansion:** Facilitates table grape, citrus, and horticultural industries

### Funding Challenge Context

The project illustrates a common challenge for regional water infrastructure: demonstrating sufficient scale of commercial beneficiaries to meet federal cost-benefit thresholds, while the actual regional development benefits (population retention, service viability, economic diversification) may not be fully captured in traditional BCR analysis.

## Environmental Considerations

### Environmental Regulatory Framework

The Hughenden Water Bank project operates within the Gulf Water Plan regulatory framework, which establishes environmental flow objectives for the Flinders River and its tributaries. Any water harvesting must adhere to these environmental flow requirements to protect downstream ecosystems and the Gulf of Carpentaria marine environment.

### Gulf Catchment Context

The Flinders River flows directly to the Gulf of Carpentaria, making its environmental health critical to both freshwater and marine ecosystems. The Gulf region is recognized for its relatively intact river systems and high conservation values.

### Environmental Protection Measures

**Gulf Water Plan Compliance:** The project is designed to operate within water allocation frameworks that maintain environmental flow objectives. This includes:
- Restrictions on when and how much water can be harvested
- Maintenance of base flows for ecosystem health
- Protection of in-stream values during water extraction

**Off-Stream Storage Approach:** The project's off-stream storage design (as opposed to in-stream dam) provides environmental benefits:
- Reduced impact on river flow dynamics
- Opportunity for strategic water harvesting during high-flow events
- Less disruption to fish passage and aquatic habitat connectivity

### Riverbank Restoration

Southern Gulf NRM has been conducting riverbank restoration work on the Flinders River near Hughenden, addressing erosion zones and degraded areas. This work includes cultural heritage surveys by Traditional Owners and employs restoration techniques such as:
- Living pile fields
- Revegetation with native grasses, trees and shrubs
- Erosion control measures

### Environmental Benefits Claims

Project proponents highlight potential environmental co-benefits:
- Efficient water use through modern irrigation infrastructure
- Opportunity for improved land management practices in irrigated agriculture
- Off-stream storage reduces pressure on in-stream water during dry periods

### Environmental Assessment Status

While detailed environmental impact assessments for the specific Water Bank project are not publicly available in the sources reviewed, the project would need to demonstrate compliance with:
- Gulf Water Plan environmental flow objectives
- Queensland water allocation frameworks
- Any relevant State and Federal environmental assessment processes depending on project scale and impacts

## First Nations and Cultural Heritage

### Traditional Owners

The Hughenden area and Flinders River region are within the **Yirandali people's** language region. Aboriginal languages closely tied to the Flinders River geography also include **Wanamara** and **Dalleburra**.

The Flinders River holds deep cultural significance for First Nations peoples, with the river's history intertwined with Aboriginal culture dating back tens of thousands of years.

### Cultural Heritage Assessment

Cultural heritage surveys have been conducted in the Hughenden/Flinders River area as part of riverbank restoration work. Southern Gulf NRM's riverbank recovery program included:
- Cultural heritage surveys by Traditional Owners
- Identification of culturally significant sites prior to restoration work
- Engagement of Traditional Owner groups in environmental restoration planning

### Gulf Water Plan and First Nations Engagement

The Gulf Water Plan review process (commenced 2024) has highlighted the need to better understand local cultural values relating to water. The Queensland Government's approach includes:
- Engagement with First Nations peoples regarding cultural water needs
- Recognition of water's cultural significance beyond consumptive uses
- Incorporation of First Nations perspectives in water planning

### Cultural Heritage Protection

For the Hughenden Water Bank project specifically, cultural heritage considerations would include:
- Cultural heritage assessment under Queensland Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003
- Consultation with Yirandali and other Traditional Owner groups
- Identification and protection of culturally significant sites in the project footprint
- Potential development of Cultural Heritage Management Plans

### Status of First Nations Engagement

Publicly available information does not detail specific consultation or engagement between Flinders Shire Council and Traditional Owner groups for the Water Bank project. This may reflect the project's planning status, or such engagement may be underway but not yet publicly documented.

The broader regional context shows increasing recognition of First Nations water interests, with the Gulf Water Plan review incorporating First Nations perspectives on cultural flows and water values.

## Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

## Regional Context

### Water Security as Regional Constraint

Water security has been identified as the **critical requirement** for achieving economic development and population growth in the Flinders Shire. The region holds significant agricultural potential but lacks reliable water supply infrastructure to support intensive irrigation agriculture.

Council's goal to double the Shire's population from 1,500 to 3,000 residents by 2030 is fundamentally dependent on water security. Without reliable water infrastructure, the region cannot attract or sustain horticultural development, processing facilities, or the population base to support regional services.

### 15 Mile Horticulture Project

The Water Bank project is the critical enabling infrastructure for the **15 Mile Horticulture Project**, a State-designated coordinated project covering 918 hectares. The 15 Mile project envisions:
- Table grape production
- Citrus cultivation
- Diversified horticultural industries
- Modern irrigated agriculture on the banks of the Flinders River

The coordinated project designation reflects State Government recognition of the strategic significance of this agricultural development opportunity.

### Regional Development Vision: "1,000 Jobs in 1,000 Days"

Flinders Shire Council's ambitious vision of creating "1,000 jobs in 1,000 days" relies on water infrastructure as the foundation. The vision encompasses:
- Horticultural development (15 Mile project and additional farms)
- Proposed Hughenden meatworks and feedlot
- Agricultural processing and value-adding industries
- Service industries supporting expanded agricultural sector

### Hughenden as Horticultural Hub

Council's strategy positions Hughenden to become a **horticulture hub for North-West Queensland**, leveraging:
- Suitable climate for high-value crops (table grapes, citrus)
- Proximity to Flinders River water resource
- Access to road transport networks
- Available land for agricultural expansion
- Strategic location in Gulf region

### Integration with HIPCo Irrigation Scheme

The 2024 MOU between Flinders Shire Council and HIPCo creates potential for a **unified regional water strategy** that integrates:
- **Council's Water Bank:** 7,000 ML off-stream storage for immediate regional needs
- **HIPCo's Irrigation Scheme:** 161,000 ML in-stream storage at Saego Station, 45 km northwest of Hughenden

The collaborative approach aims to demonstrate broader regional benefits that could attract federal infrastructure investment and create a comprehensive water security solution for the Flinders catchment.

### Gulf Region Water Planning

The project sits within the broader **Gulf Water Plan** framework, which manages water allocation across the Gulf catchment. The 2024 commencement of the Gulf Water Plan review, with $4 million in Regional Water Assessment funding, provides context for strategic water infrastructure planning in the region.

### Population and Service Sustainability

With a 2021 census population of just 1,500 people, Flinders Shire faces the challenge common to remote and rural Australian regions: maintaining viable services and economic activity with a declining or stagnant population base. Water infrastructure for agricultural development offers a pathway to:
- Economic diversification beyond traditional pastoral industries
- Employment opportunities to retain young people
- Population growth to sustain schools, health services, and businesses
- Regional resilience through economic diversity

## Lessons and Legacy

### Regional Infrastructure Funding Challenges

The Hughenden Water Bank project illustrates a fundamental tension in regional infrastructure funding:

**The BCR Challenge:** The project demonstrates positive but modest economic returns (BCR 1.09), which reflects the reality that small regional populations cannot generate the large absolute benefits that drive high BCR scores. However, the per-capita benefits and regional sustainability value may be very high.

**The Beneficiary Test:** Federal funding requirements to demonstrate "sufficient commercial beneficiaries" create a Catch-22 for remote regions: infrastructure is needed to attract population and economic activity, but funding requires demonstration of existing beneficiaries.

**Implications:** This project highlights the need for infrastructure funding frameworks that recognize regional development benefits beyond traditional cost-benefit analysis, including population retention, service viability, and regional resilience.

### Collaborative Regional Approaches

The 2024 shift to a collaborative approach with HIPCo demonstrates an important lesson:

**Scale Through Integration:** Individual regional projects may struggle to meet funding thresholds, but integrated regional water strategies that combine multiple initiatives can demonstrate broader benefits and strategic value.

**Unified Advocacy:** Coordinated regional planning strengthens the case for infrastructure investment and reduces potential for projects to compete against each other for limited funding.

**Adaptive Strategy:** The willingness to adapt from independent project delivery to collaborative regional approach shows pragmatic problem-solving in response to funding constraints.

### Off-Stream vs In-Stream Storage Trade-offs

The project's off-stream storage design offers insights into infrastructure approaches:

**Environmental Benefits:** Off-stream storage typically has lower environmental impacts than large in-stream dams, particularly for fish passage, flow dynamics, and ecosystem connectivity.

**Scale Constraints:** Off-stream storage is generally limited in scale compared to in-stream options, which may constrain the range of beneficiaries and economic case.

**Flexibility:** Off-stream storage can be operated flexibly to harvest water during high-flow events while maintaining environmental flows during dry periods.

### State vs Federal Funding Dynamics

The project demonstrates the complexity of federal-state funding dynamics for regional infrastructure:

- State government more readily funded the project based on regional development merits
- Federal government applied stricter commercial beneficiary criteria
- Projects may need to navigate different assessment frameworks and priorities at different government levels
- State funding alone ($25.6M) may be sufficient for first-stage implementation, though Council sought federal matching funds for larger scope

### Water Security as Foundation for Regional Development

The project reinforces the fundamental role of water security in enabling regional development:

**Sequence Matters:** Infrastructure must precede development. Water licenses alone (8,200 ML granted) cannot enable agricultural development without storage and distribution infrastructure.

**Compounding Benefits:** Water infrastructure enables agricultural development, which creates employment, which attracts population, which sustains services, which improves regional amenity - a virtuous cycle if the initial infrastructure can be established.

**Critical Thresholds:** Regions may be caught below critical thresholds - not enough activity to justify infrastructure, but unable to generate activity without infrastructure.

### Relevance to Queensland Water Infrastructure Planning

The Hughenden Water Bank project provides a case study relevant to:
- Gulf region water infrastructure planning and the Gulf Water Plan review
- Queensland's broader approach to regional water security
- Integration of smaller-scale projects with larger strategic initiatives
- Federal-state cooperation on regional infrastructure
- Recognition of First Nations water interests in infrastructure planning

### Future Outlook

As of late 2024/early 2025, the project's future depends on:
1. **Funding pathway:** Proceeding with state funding alone, securing federal funding through expanded benefit case, or integrating with HIPCo for larger regional project
2. **Collaborative regional approach:** Success of Council-HIPCo partnership in developing unified water strategy
3. **Gulf Water Plan review:** Outcomes of regional water assessment and planning process
4. **First Nations engagement:** Integration of cultural heritage and water interests
5. **Demonstration of demand:** Ability to attract horticultural investors to 15 Mile project and demonstrate commercial interest

The project remains a priority for Flinders Shire Council and represents critical enabling infrastructure for the region's economic development aspirations, though the pathway to construction remains uncertain pending resolution of funding and regional planning questions.
