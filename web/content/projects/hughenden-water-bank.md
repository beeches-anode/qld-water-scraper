## Project Overview

The Hughenden Water Bank is a proposed off-stream water storage facility in the Flinders Shire of North-West Queensland. The project involves a 7,000 megalitre storage facility, pumping infrastructure, and approximately 7 kilometres of pipeline to harvest water from the Flinders River for irrigated agriculture.

The project is a priority initiative for Flinders Shire Council, serving as critical enabling infrastructure for the 15 Mile Irrigation Development Project. Council holds 8,200 megalitres of water licenses, more than sufficient for the 7,000 megalitre first stage. Mayor Jane McNamara stated the funding would help materialize Council's vision and enable an additional 4-5 high-value horticultural farms to be developed.

## Project History

Flinders Shire Council identified water security as the critical constraint to regional economic development. The Council developed a water strategy securing 8,200 megalitres of river licenses and completing a business case demonstrating a BCR of 1.09 and NPV of $5.0 million.

In June 2022, the Queensland Government announced $25.6 million in funding as part of the 2022-23 State Budget's record $510 million water infrastructure investment. By late 2022, the project progressed to its expressions of interest phase, with Council describing it as "shovel ready."

Council sought matching federal funding of $25.6 million but the application encountered challenges. Federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek indicated the project needed to expand its list of commercial beneficiaries to qualify for federal support. The limited number of commercial beneficiaries—a fundamental challenge for a regional project serving a small population—constrained federal funding eligibility.

In 2024, Flinders Shire Council and the Hughenden Irrigation Project Corporation (HIPCo) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on collaborative water harvesting. This unified regional approach aims to demonstrate broader benefits by combining Council's Water Bank project with HIPCo's larger Irrigation Scheme proposal, potentially strengthening the case for federal investment.

## Environmental Considerations

The project operates within the Gulf Water Plan regulatory framework, which establishes environmental flow objectives for the Flinders River. The Flinders flows directly to the Gulf of Carpentaria, making its environmental health critical to both freshwater and marine ecosystems.

The off-stream storage design provides environmental advantages over in-stream dams, including reduced impact on river flow dynamics, opportunity for strategic water harvesting during high-flow events, and less disruption to fish passage and aquatic habitat connectivity.

Southern Gulf NRM has been conducting riverbank restoration work on the Flinders River near Hughenden, including cultural heritage surveys by Traditional Owners and erosion control measures using living pile fields and revegetation with native species.

## Cultural Heritage

The Hughenden area and Flinders River region are within the Yirandali people's language region. Aboriginal languages closely tied to the Flinders River geography also include Wanamara and Dalleburra. The river holds deep cultural significance for First Nations peoples.

Cultural heritage surveys have been conducted in the area as part of Southern Gulf NRM's riverbank recovery program, including identification of culturally significant sites prior to restoration work and engagement of Traditional Owner groups in environmental restoration planning.

The Gulf Water Plan review process commenced in 2024 has highlighted the need to better understand local cultural values relating to water, with engagement with First Nations peoples regarding cultural water needs and recognition of water's cultural significance beyond consumptive uses.

## Regional Context

Water security has been identified as the critical requirement for achieving economic development in the Flinders Shire. With a 2021 census population of just 1,500 people, Council aims to double that to 3,000 residents by 2030 through its "1,000 jobs in 1,000 days" vision.

The Water Bank is enabling infrastructure for the 15 Mile Horticulture Project, a State-designated coordinated project covering 918 hectares envisioned for table grape and citrus production. Council's strategy positions Hughenden to become a horticulture hub for North-West Queensland.

The 2024 MOU with HIPCo creates potential for an integrated regional water strategy combining Council's 7,000 ML off-stream storage with HIPCo's proposed 161,000 ML in-stream storage at Saego Station. This collaborative approach aims to demonstrate the broader regional benefits needed to attract federal infrastructure investment.
