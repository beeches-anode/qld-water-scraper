## Project Overview

The Lake Mitchell to Barron River Pipeline is a proposed water infrastructure project that would transfer water from Lake Mitchell on the Mitchell River to the Barron River catchment in Far North Queensland's Atherton Tablelands region. The project was identified through the Queensland Government's Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023) as one of the most viable options for enhancing water security in the region.

The Tablelands Regional Water Assessment involved extensive stakeholder consultation and technical analysis, considering 113 potential water supply and security initiatives. Following this comprehensive assessment, the Lake Mitchell to Barron River Pipeline was among seven options recommended for detailed business case development, subject to specific conditions and compatibility requirements.

The project builds on existing water management arrangements in the region. The current Barron Water Plan (2023) already manages inter-basin transfers between the Barron River catchment and the upper reaches of the Walsh and Mitchell rivers as part of the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme (MDWSS). This existing scheme services more than 1,000 irrigators through a network of channels, pipelines, and supplemented streams supplied from Tinaroo Falls Dam.

The Mitchell River, rising on the Atherton Tableland about 50 kilometres northwest of Cairns, has the state's largest discharge at 11.3 million megalitres annually. Lake Mitchell serves as the main water storage facility on the river. The proposed pipeline would enable water from this system to be transferred to the Barron catchment to supplement existing water supplies.

The Atherton Tablelands region supports a significant irrigation industry, with the Mareeba-Dimbulah Irrigation Area covering almost 1,200 square kilometres across the valleys of the Barron, Walsh, and Mitchell Rivers. Approximately 415 square kilometres of farmland is irrigated when Tinaroo Dam supplies 205,000 megalitres of water annually through an extensive network of 176 kilometres of channels.

Key stakeholders include the Queensland Department of Local Government, Water and Volunteers, Tablelands Regional Council, Mareeba Shire Council, Cairns Regional Council, irrigation water users, Traditional Owners, and environmental groups. The detailed business case process will involve further engagement with these stakeholders to refine the project scope and assess viability.

## Key Specifications

Detailed specifications for the Lake Mitchell to Barron River Pipeline are not yet publicly available, as the project is in the early planning stages. Key specifications will be developed through the detailed business case process and are expected to include:

- **Pipeline Length:** Distance from Lake Mitchell to connection point on Barron River system (to be determined)
- **Pipeline Diameter and Capacity:** Flow rates and volumes to be specified based on demand analysis and system modelling
- **Transfer Volumes:** Annual water transfer volumes to be determined through detailed water balance modelling
- **Connection Infrastructure:** Pumping stations, treatment facilities, and integration points with existing water supply systems
- **Operational Parameters:** Water allocation mechanisms, seasonal operation patterns, environmental flow requirements

The business case development will need to consider compatibility with existing water management arrangements, including the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme and the requirements of the Barron Water Plan 2023 and Mitchell Water Plan.

## Project History and Status

### Regional Water Assessment Phase (2021-2023)

The Lake Mitchell to Barron River Pipeline emerged from the comprehensive Tablelands Regional Water Assessment conducted by the Queensland Department of Local Government, Water and Volunteers.

**Late 2021:** The Tablelands Regional Water Assessment commenced, involving technical analysis and extensive stakeholder engagement to identify water supply and security options for the region.

**Assessment Process:** Stakeholders helped identify and consider 113 potential water supply and security initiatives in the assessment area, which spans from the Tablelands Regional Council area through to eastern parts of Mareeba Shire Council and the western part of Cairns Regional Council. The RWA process involved:
