## Project Overview

The Lake Mitchell to Barron River Pipeline is a proposed inter-basin water transfer that emerged from the Queensland Government's Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023). The assessment considered 113 potential water supply initiatives identified through stakeholder consultation, with this pipeline among seven options recommended for detailed business case development.

The project would transfer water from Lake Mitchell on the Mitchell River—which has Queensland's largest discharge at 11.3 million megalitres annually—to the Barron River catchment. This would supplement existing supplies for the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme (MDWSS), which services more than 1,000 irrigators across approximately 415 square kilometres of farmland through 176 kilometres of channels and pipelines supplied from Tinaroo Falls Dam.

Inter-basin transfers already exist in the region. The Barron Water Plan (2023) manages transfers between the Barron catchment and upper reaches of the Walsh and Mitchell rivers as part of the MDWSS. The proposed Lake Mitchell pipeline would represent a new, additional transfer arrangement requiring amendments to both the Barron and Mitchell water plans.

## Project History

The Tablelands Regional Water Assessment commenced in late 2021, covering the Tablelands Regional Council area, eastern Mareeba Shire, and western Cairns Regional Council. The assessment involved extensive stakeholder engagement to identify water security options for the region.

In June 2023, the Queensland Government released the draft assessment for public consultation. The draft identified the Lake Mitchell to Barron River pipeline as one option that should proceed to detailed business case, subject to conditions and compatibility requirements. The final assessment maintained this recommendation.

The project is currently in the planning phase awaiting business case development. Regional stakeholders have noted that long-term water infrastructure options will only be viable if there is at least 90% government investment due to high construction costs.

## Environmental Considerations

As an inter-basin transfer, the project raises significant environmental considerations for both catchments. The Mitchell River supports diverse aquatic ecosystems, and extraction would need to maintain environmental flows. The Barron system already receives inter-basin transfers, but additional inputs could affect water quality and ecosystem dynamics.

Both catchments contribute to Great Barrier Reef waters, making water quality impacts particularly important. The Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan targets may be relevant. Biosecurity risks include potential transfer of aquatic pests or diseases between catchments—the existing MDWSS already operates pest fish exclusion screens.

Environmental impact assessment under Queensland legislation will be required, with potential Commonwealth referral under the EPBC Act given proximity to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area spans traditional lands of multiple First Nations groups with connections to both river systems. Rivers and water bodies often hold deep spiritual and cultural significance, and both the Mitchell and Barron systems are important for traditional practices and connection to country.

Comprehensive cultural heritage assessment under the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld) will be required, including development of a Cultural Heritage Management Plan. Native title considerations may also apply. Meaningful consultation with Traditional Owners will be essential throughout the business case and any subsequent project phases.

## Regional Context

The pipeline would integrate with the existing Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme, which has recently undergone efficiency improvements saving at least 11,500 ML annually through 14 kilometres of new pipeline construction. The Barron water system also supplies townships including Tinaroo, Walkamin, Mareeba, Kuranda, Yungaburra, Mutchilba, and Dimbulah.

The Atherton Tablelands supports diverse agricultural production including intensive horticulture, sugar cane, tropical fruits, dairy, and coffee. Enhanced water security could enable agricultural expansion and increased reliability for existing users.

The Johnstone River to Tinaroo Falls Dam Pipeline was also recommended for business case development by the same assessment, representing an alternative or complementary water transfer option for the region. The relative merits of these options will be informed by their respective business cases.
