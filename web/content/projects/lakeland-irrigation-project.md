## Project Overview

The Lakeland Irrigation Project proposes constructing a 296,000 megalitre dam on the Palmer River, approximately 23km southwest of Lakeland in Cook Shire, Far North Queensland. The dam would create a reliable water supply for up to 10,000 hectares of high-quality agricultural land, utilizing less than 1% of the Mitchell River system's annual outflow of 15,570 GL.

Regional Development Australia Tropical North led the project's development in consultation with Cook Shire Council, Western Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation, and local growers. The scheme would include the dam, a 12km tunnel to gravity-feed water to Lakeland township and surrounding irrigation areas, plus distribution systems.

Despite projected agricultural and employment benefits, the Detailed Business Case published in April 2024 revealed significant economic challenges: a benefit-cost ratio of only 0.13-0.37, meaning only 13-37 cents of economic benefit per dollar invested. The project would require approximately 97% government funding to proceed.

## Project History

The project was conceived to unlock agricultural potential in the Lakeland district, which has high-quality arable land but lacks reliable water for intensive agriculture. In 2020, the Commonwealth Government awarded $10 million through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund for a comprehensive business case.

The business case phase included reference design development, geotechnical investigations, environmental field studies, cultural heritage assessment, and stakeholder consultation. The business case was completed in August 2023, with the Detailed Business Case published in April 2024.

The April 2024 publication revealed substantial barriers: insufficient unallocated water in the Mitchell Water Plan (which expires in 2027), very poor economic returns, and unresolved environmental and cultural heritage concerns. The project has not progressed to formal approvals or secured construction funding.

## Environmental Considerations

The project area connects to the Great Barrier Reef through the Laura River basin, creating significant water quality concerns. The Cairns and Far North Environment Centre (CAFNEC) has raised concerns about increased nutrient and sediment runoff from 10,000 hectares of intensive irrigation affecting the reef.

Environmental impacts would include alteration of the Palmer River's natural flow regime, loss of riparian habitat in the inundation area, and potential introduction of invasive species. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement has not yet been undertaken and would be required if the project proceeds.

The Mitchell Water Plan currently lacks sufficient unallocated water for the project's 105,000 ML annual offtake requirement. The plan's 2027 expiry and subsequent review creates uncertainty about future water availability.

## Cultural Heritage

Traditional Owner perspectives on the project are divided. The Western Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation has partnered in project development, with CEO Brad Grogan stating the project would bring "immense potential and benefit to Traditional Owners as well as the wider community."

However, the Kwanji Warra people submitted an objection through CAFNEC, raising concerns about flooding of sacred sites, impacts on their connection to the Palmer River and surrounding country, and disruption of culturally significant ecosystems. Reconciling these differing Traditional Owner perspectives remains unresolved.

## Regional Context

The project is part of broader aspirations to develop Northern Australia's agricultural potential. Supporters including Federal Member Warren Entsch, Cook Shire Council, and regional business groups view it as critical infrastructure for Far North Queensland's economic development.

The Queensland Government has raised concerns about economic viability given the low benefit-cost ratio. Critics have drawn comparisons to Murray-Darling Basin over-allocation issues. The project's future depends on the Mitchell Water Plan review outcomes, securing substantial government funding despite poor economics, and addressing environmental and cultural heritage objections.
