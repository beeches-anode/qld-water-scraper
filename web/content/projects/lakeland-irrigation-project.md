## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Lakeland Irrigation Project proposes to construct a 296,000 megalitre (ML) dam on the Palmer River, approximately 23km southwest of Lakeland in Cook Shire, Far North Queensland. The project would create a reliable water supply for up to 10,000 hectares of high-quality agricultural land, utilizing less than 1% of the Mitchell River system's annual outflow.

The project was developed by Regional Development Australia (RDA) Tropical North in consultation with Cook Shire Council, the Western Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation, and Lakeland growers. It aims to unlock the agricultural potential of the Lakeland district, which has been identified as having significant high-quality arable land suitable for intensive horticulture and diverse cropping.

The scheme would involve construction of a dam with 296,000 ML storage capacity and an annual offtake of up to 105,000 ML. Infrastructure would include a 12km tunnel to gravity-feed water to Lakeland township and the surrounding irrigation area, along with associated distribution systems. The project would provide improved water security not only for agricultural expansion but also for the Lakeland township itself.

Key stakeholders include the Queensland and Commonwealth governments, the National Water Grid Authority (which funded the business case), local growers and landholders, Traditional Owner groups, and regional development organizations. The project fits into broader strategies for developing Northern Australia's agricultural potential and supporting regional economic growth in Far North Queensland.

### Project History and Status

#### Initial Conception and Feasibility Phase

The Lakeland Irrigation Scheme was conceived as a response to the identified agricultural potential of the Lakeland district, which possesses high-quality arable land but lacks reliable water supply for intensive agriculture. Regional Development Australia Tropical North led the initial development of the proposal, recognizing the opportunity to unlock agricultural development in Far North Queensland.

The project gained momentum with recognition under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, which provides funding for feasibility studies and business case development for water infrastructure projects across Australia.

#### Business Case Development (2020-2023)

In 2020, the Commonwealth Government awarded funding for the development of a comprehensive business case. The $10 million business case was funded through the feasibility component of the $1.5 billion National Water Infrastructure Development Fund.

The business case investigated the viability of constructing a new dam on the Palmer River and an associated distribution system to transfer water to and around the Lakeland area. The study examined various dam sizes and configurations, ultimately recommending a 296,000 ML capacity dam with 105,000 ML annual offtake to service up to 10,000 hectares of irrigation.

Work undertaken during the business case phase included:
- Reference design development
- Geotechnical investigations
- Environmental field studies
- Cultural heritage assessment
- Stakeholder consultation and management
- Economic and financial analysis
- Engineering and technical feasibility assessment

The business case was completed in August 2023, with the National Water Grid Authority confirming project completion.

#### Detailed Business Case Publication (April 2024)

A Detailed Business Case was published in April 2024, providing comprehensive analysis of the project's technical feasibility, economic viability, environmental considerations, and implementation pathway. This document revealed several significant challenges:

**Economic Challenges:**
- Total scheme cost estimated at approximately $2 billion in 2023 dollars (or $2.5 billion including contingencies)
- Benefit-Cost Ratio of only 0.13 to 0.37, indicating very poor economic returns
- Only 13-37 cents of economic benefit generated for every dollar invested
- Project would require approximately 97% government grants and subsidies
- Queensland Government raised significant concerns about economic viability

**Water Allocation Challenges:**
- Insufficient unallocated water in the current Mitchell Water Plan to meet project needs
- Mitchell Water Plan expires in 2027; review could potentially increase available water
- No guarantee that water plan review will provide sufficient allocation
- Concerns about impacts on existing water users and environmental flows

#### Current Status (2024)

The project has completed its business case and feasibility phase but has not progressed to formal approvals or funding for construction. The path forward is uncertain due to:

- Very low benefit-cost ratio making government funding justification difficult
- Water allocation constraints under existing Mitchell Water Plan
- Environmental concerns raised by conservation groups
- Opposition from some Traditional Owner groups
- Need for comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement
- Requirement for multiple regulatory approvals

The project remains in planning status, with advocacy continuing from supporters including RDA Tropical North, Warren Entsch MP (Federal Member for Leichhardt), Cook Shire Council, and local agricultural interests. However, progression to construction phase appears unlikely without significant changes to economics, water allocation framework, or funding arrangements.

**Environmental Assessment:**
- Emphasizes importance of considering downstream impacts, particularly Great Barrier Reef water quality
- Demonstrates need for cumulative impact assessment, not just project-specific impacts
- Shows challenge of balancing agricultural development with environmental protection in reef catchments
- Highlights ongoing tension between irrigation expansion and water quality objectives

#### Best Practices

**Business Case Development:**
- Comprehensive feasibility study funded through National Water Infrastructure Development Fund
- Reference design, geotechnical investigations, and field studies undertaken
- Cultural heritage assessment included in business case phase
- Stakeholder consultation and engagement throughout business case development
- Publication of detailed business case providing transparency

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
- Partnership approach with RDA Tropical North, Cook Shire Council, and Western Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation
- Consultation with growers and agricultural sector
- Engagement with environmental groups and broader community
- Transparent communication of project details and findings

#### Challenges Encountered

**Economic Viability:**
- Very low benefit-cost ratio (0.13-0.37) undermines project justification
- Requirement for 97% government funding creates fiscal challenges
- Difficulty reconciling regional development aspirations with poor economic returns
- Challenge of quantifying and valuing regional development benefits beyond direct BCR

**Water Allocation:**
- Insufficient unallocated water in Mitchell Water Plan
- Uncertainty about water plan review outcomes (post-2027)
- Difficulty planning long-term infrastructure with water allocation uncertainty
- Tension between abundant water resource and allocation framework constraints

**Divergent Stakeholder Perspectives:**
- Opposition from Kwanji Warra people despite Western Yalanji support
- Environmental groups raising significant concerns
- Queensland Government concerns about economics despite federal and regional support
- Difficulty building consensus across diverse stakeholder groups

**Environmental Complexity:**
- Great Barrier Reef water quality considerations adding complexity
- Challenge of irrigation expansion in reef catchment
- Cumulative impact assessment requirements
- Comparison to Murray-Darling Basin environmental issues creating reputational challenges

#### Legacy and Future Implications

**Precedent Setting:**
If the project proceeds despite poor economic returns:
- Could set precedent for government funding of economically marginal water infrastructure
- May encourage other regions to advocate for similar projects
- Could influence water allocation decisions in other catchments
- May affect expectations about government support for regional development infrastructure

If the project does not proceed:
- Demonstrates that rigorous economic assessment can prevent poor investments
- May discourage proposals for irrigation expansion in reef catchments
- Could influence approach to regional water infrastructure development
- May shift focus to more economically viable water security approaches

**Water Planning Implications:**
- Highlights importance of water plan frameworks in enabling or constraining development
- May influence Mitchell Water Plan review processes
- Could affect approaches to balancing development and environmental flows
- May shape future water allocation policy in northern Australia

**Great Barrier Reef Water Quality:**
- Demonstrates ongoing tension between agricultural development and reef protection
- Highlights challenges in achieving Reef 2050 water quality targets while supporting agricultural growth
- May influence policy approaches to irrigation expansion in reef catchments
- Could affect future development proposals in Great Barrier Reef catchment areas

**Regional Development Approach:**
- May influence approach to "Northern Australia food bowl" vision
- Could shape expectations about government support for regional infrastructure
- May affect balance between economic viability and regional development objectives
- Could influence prioritization of regional development investments

#### Comparable Projects

The Lakeland Irrigation Project can be compared to:
- **Hells Gates Dam (Burdekin):** Another major northern Queensland water infrastructure proposal with economic viability questions
- **Murray-Darling Basin irrigation expansion:** Historical precedent often cited by critics regarding over-allocation and environmental degradation
- **Ord River Irrigation Scheme:** Northern Australia irrigation development with mixed economic outcomes
- **Bradfield Scheme proposals:** Long-standing northern Queensland water infrastructure concepts
- **Other National Water Infrastructure Development Fund projects:** Similar business case development approach

**Key Differences:**
- Lakeland's extremely low BCR (0.13-0.37) is particularly challenging
- Direct connection to Great Barrier Reef catchment creates unique environmental sensitivities
- Relatively modest scale (10,000 ha) compared to some comparable projects
- Strong Traditional Owner partnership (Western Yalanji) differentiates from some historical projects

#### Future Implications for Water Infrastructure Planning

**Assessment and Decision-Making:**
- Demonstrates value of comprehensive business case before major commitments
- Highlights importance of transparent publication of economic analysis
- Shows need for realistic rather than optimistic economic projections
- Emphasizes role of benefit-cost analysis in infrastructure decision-making

**Funding and Financing:**
- Raises questions about appropriate government role in funding economically marginal infrastructure
- Highlights challenges of projects requiring 97% government subsidy
- May influence National Water Infrastructure Development Fund priorities and criteria
- Could affect expectations about blended funding models for water infrastructure

**Environmental and Cultural Heritage:**
- Demonstrates need for early, comprehensive environmental and cultural heritage assessment
- Highlights importance of Traditional Owner engagement throughout project development
- Shows complexity of balancing development, environment, and cultural heritage
- May influence approaches to irrigation projects in environmentally sensitive catchments

**Regional Development:**
- Raises questions about relationship between economic viability and regional development objectives
- Highlights tension between local advocacy and state/national economic rationalism
- May influence approaches to evaluating regional development benefits beyond direct BCR
- Could affect how regional water security and agricultural development are prioritized

The Lakeland Irrigation Project, regardless of whether it proceeds, provides valuable lessons about water infrastructure planning, economic assessment, stakeholder engagement, and the complex balance between development aspirations and environmental protection in the context of northern Australia's abundant but environmentally significant water resources.
