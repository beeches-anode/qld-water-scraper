## Project Overview

The Nathan Dam and Pipelines Project is a proposed major water infrastructure development on the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The project comprises a large dam with storage capacity of 888,312 ML and an annual yield of 66,011 ML, along with a pipeline network approximately 220 kilometres in length extending from the dam site through the Dawson-Callide and Surat Coal Basin area to Warra.

The project was conceived to address water supply needs for the coal mining sector in the Surat and Bowen Basins, along with power generation, urban centres, and agricultural users. Initial proposals included irrigation development of up to 30,000 hectares, primarily for cotton, though federal environmental approval in 2017 included restrictions on new agricultural water allocations due to concerns about impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.

Despite receiving environmental approvals in 2017, the project has not proceeded due to insufficient water demand from the mining sector. The Environmental Impact Statement expired in June 2021, and the Queensland Government lists the project as "discontinued or on hold."

## Project History

The Nathan Gorge site on the Dawson River was first identified for dam development in the 1920s. This early proposal led to the forced transfer of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement to Duaringa in 1927 to make way for anticipated development. The dam was not constructed at that time.

The modern iteration began in 2002 when Sudaw Developments Limited applied for federal approval to build an 880,000 ML dam for irrigation of up to 30,000 hectares. This triggered landmark environmental litigation when the Queensland Conservation Council and WWF-Australia challenged the approval process under the EPBC Act. In the 2003-2004 Federal Court proceedings, Justice Susan Keifel ruled that environmental impact assessment must consider indirect impacts, including pollution from farmers using dam water that could affect the Great Barrier Reef. The Full Court upheld this interpretation, establishing that impacts include "the whole, cumulated and continuing effect" of an activity.

In 2006, the Queensland Government's Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy identified Nathan Dam as the preferred water supply solution for the region. SunWater was appointed as proponent in 2007. In November 2012, the ACCC granted authorisation for six coal producers to collectively negotiate water supply terms with SunWater. An EIS was completed in 2012, followed by an Additional EIS in 2016.

The Coordinator-General released the evaluation report on 31 May 2017, recommending the project proceed subject to conditions. Federal EPBC Act approval followed on 13 July 2017, with conditions restricting new agricultural water allocations to address Great Barrier Reef concerns.

The project stalled due to market research indicating insufficient water demand. The EIS expired in June 2021. In May 2025, Toowoomba Regional Council called for a new feasibility study into a regional raw water supply scheme, representing renewed interest with different objectives than the original mining-focused proposal.

## Environmental Considerations

The Dawson River flows into the Fitzroy River, which discharges into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. This connection made potential impacts on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area a central concern throughout the assessment process.

The landmark 2003-2004 Federal Court case established that environmental impact assessment under the EPBC Act must consider indirect impacts from irrigation water users, including agricultural runoff containing nutrients and chemicals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority commissioned a literature review of potential downstream impacts on the Dawson River, Fitzroy River, and offshore environments.

Key environmental concerns included changes to natural flow patterns in the Dawson and Fitzroy River systems, impacts on aquatic ecosystems, altered flooding regimes affecting floodplain ecology, and cumulative water quality impacts from potential irrigation development.

The 2017 federal approval addressed these concerns by including restrictions on new water allocations for agriculture, directly limiting the irrigation expansion that had been central to the original proposal.

## Cultural Heritage

The Nathan Dam site is located within the traditional lands of several First Nations groups. The Traditional Owners acknowledged in the Banana region include the Darumbal, Gangulu, Wadja, Wulli Wulli, Wakka Wakka, and Iman (Yiman) people. The Iman people are specifically associated with the Dawson River area near Taroom.

The area carries significant historical trauma related to First Nations displacement. By 1910, approximately 100 dispossessed Aboriginal people were camped around Taroom township. The Queensland Government established the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement in 1911 as an early Aboriginal reserve. In 1927, the government proposal for a dam at Nathan Gorge led to the forcible transfer of the settlement to Duaringa.

This history means the Nathan Dam proposal carries particular cultural sensitivity, as the same location that prompted displacement nearly a century ago has been repeatedly proposed for dam development. The EIS included a chapter on Indigenous cultural heritage, and cultural heritage management plans were developed as part of the approval process.

## Regional Context

The project was closely linked to resource sector development in the Surat and Bowen Basins. The ACCC authorisation process in 2012-2013, involving six major coal producers (Cockatoo Coal, Cuesta Coal, MetroCoal, Peabody Energy Australia, QC Resource Investments, and Whitehaven Coal), reflected mining sector interest in securing water supplies.

A prolonged moratorium on irrigation permits was in place from the early 1990s in the Dawson Valley in anticipation of the dam development, creating tension with local agricultural producers seeking direct water access.

Stakeholder positions have been divided. Coal producers and regional councils including Western Downs and Toowoomba have supported the project, while environmental groups led by the Queensland Conservation Council and WWF-Australia opposed it through legal challenges. Some local agricultural producers raised concerns about water allocation impacts and potential flooding of agricultural land.

Recent discussions have shifted from a full-scale dam to alternative proposals, including a smaller Nathan Weir with capacity of approximately 22,000 ML. The 2025 interest from Toowoomba Regional Council focuses on urban water supply rather than the original mining and irrigation objectives.
