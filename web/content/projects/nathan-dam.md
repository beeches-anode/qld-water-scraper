- **Secondary Benefits:** Potential flood mitigation benefits; development of regional water infrastructure.

### Timeline

- **Project Phases:**
  - **Conception:** First proposed in 1920s; led to relocation of Taroom Aboriginal Settlement in 1927
  - **Modern Revival:** 2002 - Sudaw Developments Limited applied for federal approval for 880,000 ML dam
  - **Feasibility Phase:** 2006 - Identified in Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy; 2007 - SunWater appointed as proponent
  - **Planning and Assessment:** 2012 - Environmental Impact Statement completed and released for public comment; 2016 - Additional Environmental Impact Statement released
  - **Approval Phase:** May 2017 - Coordinator-General's evaluation report released; July 2017 - EPBC Act approval granted with conditions
  - **Current Status:** June 2021 - EIS expired; 2025 - Renewed interest from Toowoomba Regional Council for feasibility study

- **Key Milestones:**
  - November 2012: ACCC granted interim authorisation for coal producers to collectively negotiate with SunWater
  - February 2013: ACCC final authorisation granted
  - 2012: EIS finalised and released for public comment
  - 31 May 2017: Coordinator-General released evaluation report recommending project proceed subject to conditions
  - 13 July 2017: Federal Environment Minister approved project under EPBC Act with conditions including restriction on new water for agriculture
  - June 2021: EIS expired
  - May 2025: Toowoomba Regional Council called for new feasibility study

- **Current Phase:** Project on hold; no active development or construction

### Status

- **Approval Status:** The Coordinator-General's evaluation report (May 2017) recommended the project proceed subject to conditions. Federal EPBC Act approval was granted on 13 July 2017 with conditions including restrictions on new water for agriculture. However, the Environmental Impact Statement expired in June 2021, and the project would require renewed assessment processes to proceed.

- **Work Status:** Project on hold. No engineering, design, or construction work underway. Market research has indicated insufficient demand to support further development or construction at this time.

- **Community Perception:** Mixed community response. Local agricultural producers around Taroom have expressed concerns about water allocation impacts and potential flooding of agricultural land. Coal mining interests in the Surat and Bowen Basins expressed interest through collective ACCC authorisation in 2012-2013, though insufficient demand has subsequently been identified. Toowoomba Regional Council and Western Downs Regional Council have expressed renewed interest in 2025 for a regional raw water supply scheme.

- **Political Support:** The project received Queensland Government support through the 2006 Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy and subsequent Coordinator-General evaluation in 2017. Federal approval was granted in 2017. However, the project has not progressed due to lack of commercial viability and water demand. Renewed advocacy from regional councils in 2025 indicates ongoing local government support.

- **Overall Project Status:** Discontinued/On Hold - While approvals were obtained in 2017, the project has not proceeded due to insufficient market demand. The EIS expiration in 2021 would require renewal of environmental assessment processes before the project could proceed.

### Environmental Considerations

- **Key Environmental Risks:**
  - Impacts on Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area through altered water flows and potential agricultural runoff containing nutrients and chemicals
  - Changes to downstream environmental flows in the Dawson River and Fitzroy River systems
  - Impacts on aquatic ecosystems and fauna in the lower Dawson floodplain
  - Flooding of up to 30,000 hectares for irrigation development, with associated land clearing and habitat loss
  - Cumulative impacts from irrigation runoff on water quality in rivers flowing to the Great Barrier Reef

- **Mitigation Measures:** The 2017 Coordinator-General's evaluation report recommended the project proceed subject to conditions. Federal EPBC Act approval included conditions, notably restrictions on new water allocations for agriculture to address concerns about agricultural runoff impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.

- **Environmental Benefits:** Potential for regulated environmental flows; possible flood mitigation benefits for downstream communities.

- **Regulatory Requirements:** Required assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) due to potential impacts on Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. EIS was required and completed in 2012, with Additional EIS in 2016. The EIS expired in June 2021.

### Cultural Heritage

- **Traditional Owners:** The Traditional Owners of the Banana region (which includes Taroom and the Nathan Dam site) include the Darumbal, Gangulu, Wadja, Wulli Wulli, Wakka Wakka and Iman (Yiman) people. The Iman (Yiman) people are specifically associated with the Dawson River area near Taroom.

- **Cultural Heritage Status:** The Environmental Impact Statement included a chapter on Indigenous cultural heritage (Chapter 22). Cultural heritage assessments were conducted as part of the EIS process.

- **Key Concerns:** The area has significant historical connections to First Nations displacement. By 1910, approximately 100 dispossessed Aboriginal people were camped around Taroom township. The Taroom Aboriginal Settlement was established in 1911 as an early Aboriginal reserve run by the Queensland government. A government proposal for a dam at Nathan Gorge in the 1920s led to the settlement being forcibly transferred to the Duaringa area in 1927.

- **Protection Measures:** Cultural heritage management plans were developed as part of the EIS process. The historic heritage management plan addressed both Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultural heritage values.

## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Nathan Dam and Pipelines Project is a proposed major water infrastructure development on the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The project comprises a large dam with a storage capacity of 888,312 ML at full supply level and an annual yield of 66,011 ML, along with a pipeline network approximately 220 kilometres in length extending from the dam site through the Dawson-Callide and Surat Coal Basin area to Warra.

The project was conceived to address water supply needs in a region experiencing significant resource sector development, particularly coal mining in the Surat and Bowen Basins. The dam site is located approximately 75 km downstream of the town of Taroom and 11 km downstream of the existing Glebe Weir on the Dawson River, positioned about 8 km upstream of Nathan Gorge.

The project has a long and complex history. The Nathan Gorge site was first identified for dam development in the 1920s, and a government proposal for a dam at that time resulted in the displacement of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement to Duaringa in 1927. The modern iteration of the project emerged in 2002 when Sudaw Developments Limited applied for federal environmental approval to construct and operate an 880,000 megalitre dam. In 2006, the Queensland Government's Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy identified Nathan Dam as the preferred short to medium-term water supply solution for the region, and in 2007 SunWater Limited was appointed as the project proponent to develop a business case.

The project aims to provide long-term, reliable water supplies to mining operations, power generation, urban centres, and existing agricultural users in the Surat Coal Basin and the Dawson sub-region of Central Queensland. Initial proposals included irrigation development of up to 30,000 hectares, primarily for cotton growing, though federal environmental approval in 2017 included restrictions on new water allocations for agriculture due to concerns about impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.

The project became the subject of landmark environmental law litigation in the early 2000s and has faced ongoing challenges related to environmental impacts, commercial viability, and changing water demand in the region.

### Project History and Status

#### Early Proposals (1920s-1990s)

The Nathan Gorge site on the Dawson River was first identified as a potential dam location in the 1920s. This early government proposal for a dam at Nathan Gorge led to significant social impacts, with the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement being transferred to Duaringa in 1927 to make way for the anticipated development. However, the dam was not constructed at that time.

From the early 1990s, the Queensland Government imposed a prolonged moratorium on irrigation permits in the Dawson Valley in anticipation of future dam development.

#### Modern Revival and Initial Approvals (2002-2006)

The modern iteration of the Nathan Dam proposal began in 2002 when Sudaw Developments Limited applied to the Federal Environment Minister for approval to build and operate an 880,000 megalitre dam on the Dawson River. The stated purpose was to supply water for irrigation of up to 30,000 hectares of farmland, mostly for cotton growing, in the lower Dawson River Valley.

This application triggered a landmark environmental law case when the Queensland Conservation Council and WWF-Australia challenged the Federal Environment Minister's decision-making process under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The case, heard in the Federal Court in September 2003, centred on whether the environmental impacts of the dam should include indirect effects such as pollution from farmers using water supplied by the dam, with agricultural chemical runoff potentially affecting the Great Barrier Reef.

Justice Susan Keifel found in 2003 that the Minister had erred and should take a wide approach to considering impacts, extending to the "whole, cumulated and continuing effect" of an activity. An appeal was heard in the Full Court of the Federal Court in 2004, which upheld this interpretation. The Full Court ruled that impacts of an action under the EPBC Act include all effects, whether direct or indirect, which are sufficiently close to the action to allow it to be said that they are consequences of the action on protected matters. This decision set an important precedent for how federal environmental assessments consider indirect and cumulative impacts.

In 2006, the Queensland Government released its Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy, which identified Nathan Dam as the preferred short to medium-term water supply solution for the Dawson-Callide sub-region.

#### SunWater Appointment and Business Case Development (2007-2012)

In July 2007, SunWater Limited was appointed as the proponent to develop a business case for the Nathan Dam and Pipelines Project. The project scope expanded to focus on providing water to the coal mining sector in the Surat and Bowen Basins, in addition to agricultural and urban uses.

In November 2012, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) granted interim authorisation for six Queensland coal producers (Cockatoo Coal Limited, Cuesta Coal Limited, MetroCoal Limited, Peabody Energy Australia PCI Pty Ltd, QC Resource Investments, and Whitehaven Coal) to collectively discuss and negotiate terms and conditions of water supply and development of the Nathan Dam Project with SunWater. This authorisation, which would normally raise competition concerns, was permitted to enable more efficient negotiation. Final ACCC authorisation was granted in February 2013.

An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project was finalised and released for public comment in 2012. The EIS documented detailed studies to determine optimal dam and pipeline design and costs, expected water availability and demands, and overall environmental, social and economic impacts of the project.

#### Additional Assessment and Approvals (2016-2017)

Following assessment of the EIS and public submissions, the Coordinator-General requested that SunWater prepare additional information. An Additional Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS) was released for public consultation in 2016.

On 31 May 2017, the Queensland Coordinator-General released the Environmental Impact Statement evaluation report to the Federal Government under the bilateral agreement and recommended the project proceed subject to recommendations and conditions made in the report.

On 13 July 2017, the Federal Minister for the Environment and Energy approved the project under the EPBC Act. The approval included significant conditions, notably restrictions on new water allocations for agriculture, addressing the concerns about agricultural runoff impacts on the Great Barrier Reef that had been central to the earlier legal challenges.

#### Project on Hold (2017-Present)

Despite receiving environmental approvals in 2017, the project did not proceed to construction. Market research indicated there was not sufficient demand from the mining sector and other potential customers to support further development or construction at this time. The project remains dependent on demand expectations from key customers and the completion of a detailed business case by the Queensland Government.

The Environmental Impact Statement expired in June 2021. The Queensland Government website lists Nathan Dam under "projects discontinued or on hold."

#### Renewed Interest and Alternative Proposals (2023-2025)

In recent years, discussions have shifted from a full-scale dam to alternative proposals, including a smaller Nathan Weir with a capacity of around 22,000 megalitres.

In May 2025, findings from a Nathan Dam pre-feasibility memo indicated potential benefits of a regional raw water supply scheme from the proposed Nathan Dam. Toowoomba Regional Council formally called on the Queensland Government to support a comprehensive new feasibility study into a regional raw water supply from the proposed Nathan Dam on the Dawson River. Western Downs Regional Council has also maintained advocacy for the project.

The long-dormant project has thus returned to public discussion, though no formal feasibility study or business case development is currently underway.

### Financial Details

- **Total Project Cost:** Estimated at approximately $1.19 billion for the complete Nathan Dam and Pipelines Project (2017 estimate). The dam construction component was estimated at approximately $650 million, with pipeline infrastructure comprising the balance.

- **Funding Sources:** No funding has been committed to the project from federal, state, or local government sources. The project model anticipated private sector participation and commercial water supply arrangements with mining companies and other users.

- **Funding Timeline:** No funding has been secured. The project has remained dependent on demonstrating commercial viability through sufficient water demand and completion of a detailed business case.

- **Cost Variations:** A 2017 media report referenced the project cost as approximately $1.19 billion. An earlier estimate for a pipeline extension from the Nathan Dam to Toowoomba was $750 million, excluding dam construction costs. Precise cost breakdown information has not been made publicly available.

- **Economic Analysis:** Detailed economic impact projections and cost-benefit analysis results have not been publicly released. The project business case has not been finalized.

- **Operating Costs:** Information on ongoing operational and maintenance costs has not been publicly disclosed.

- **Revenue Streams:** The project model anticipated revenue from water sales to mining operations, power generation facilities, urban water utilities, and agricultural users. The ACCC authorisation process in 2012-2013 enabled six coal producers to collectively negotiate water supply terms with SunWater. However, subsequent market research indicated insufficient demand to support the project's commercial viability.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

The Nathan Dam project underwent extensive environmental impact assessment processes. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was completed and released for public comment in 2012, followed by an Additional Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS) in 2016 after the Coordinator-General requested further information.

The Coordinator-General's evaluation report was released on 31 May 2017, recommending the project proceed subject to conditions. Federal approval under the EPBC Act was granted on 13 July 2017. The EIS expired in June 2021.

#### Ecosystem Impacts

The Nathan Dam would significantly alter the hydrology of the Dawson River system. The Dawson River flows into the Fitzroy River, which discharges into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Key ecosystem concerns include:

- Changes to natural flow patterns in the Dawson and Fitzroy River systems
- Impacts on aquatic ecosystems adapted to natural flow variability
- Effects on fauna of the lower Dawson floodplain
- Altered flooding regimes affecting floodplain ecology
- Impacts on downstream ecosystems dependent on natural flow patterns

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority commissioned a literature review and scoping study of the potential downstream impacts of the proposed Nathan Dam on the Dawson River, Fitzroy River and offshore environments.

#### Water Quality

Water quality impacts were a central concern in the environmental assessment and legal challenges to the project:

- Potential for agricultural runoff containing nutrients, pesticides and other chemicals to affect water quality in the Dawson and Fitzroy Rivers
- Cumulative impacts on water quality in rivers flowing to the Great Barrier Reef
- The landmark 2003-2004 federal court case established that environmental impact assessment must consider indirect impacts, including pollution from irrigation water users
- Concerns about sediment loads and changes to natural sediment transport patterns

#### Downstream Effects

The project raised significant concerns about downstream impacts:

- Altered flow regimes affecting downstream ecosystems and water users
- Impacts on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area from changed freshwater flows and potential pollution
- Effects on existing downstream water users and their allocations
- Changes to natural flood patterns, with some proponents arguing the dam could provide flood mitigation benefits for Theodore, while others raised concerns about agricultural land flooding from irrigation development
- The Environmental Defenders Office and environmental groups argued the project would harm the Great Barrier Reef through both direct hydrological changes and indirect impacts from irrigation expansion

#### Mitigation Strategies

The 2017 approvals included conditions designed to mitigate environmental impacts:

- Federal EPBC Act approval included restrictions on new water allocations for agriculture, directly addressing concerns about agricultural runoff impacts on the Great Barrier Reef
- The Resource Operations Licence (ROL) framework outlines environmental release rules for the Dawson Valley Water Supply Scheme
- Monitoring and reporting obligations for water quality and environmental flows
- Cultural heritage management plans for Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage values

#### Environmental Benefits

Some proponents argued potential environmental benefits:

- Regulated environmental flow releases to support downstream ecosystems
- Potential flood mitigation for downstream communities such as Theodore
- Improved water security potentially reducing pressure on other water sources

However, these claimed benefits were contested by environmental groups who maintained the overall environmental impacts, particularly on the Great Barrier Reef, would be negative.

#### Ongoing Monitoring

The approval framework included requirements for environmental monitoring and reporting, though these have not been implemented as the project has not proceeded to construction.

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The Nathan Dam site on the Dawson River near Taroom is located within the traditional lands of several First Nations groups. The Traditional Owners acknowledged in the Banana region (which includes Taroom and the Nathan Dam area) are the Darumbal, the Gangulu, the Wadja, the Wulli Wulli, the Wakka Wakka and the Iman people. The Iman (Yiman) people are specifically associated with the Dawson River area near Taroom.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

The Environmental Impact Statement included a chapter on Indigenous cultural heritage (Chapter 22). Cultural heritage assessments were conducted to identify sites and values that might be affected by the project. A Historic Heritage Management Plan was also prepared, addressing both Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultural heritage.

#### Consultation Process

Consultation with Traditional Owner groups was conducted as part of the EIS process, though detailed information about the consultation framework and outcomes has not been widely publicized.

#### Cultural Heritage Concerns

The Nathan Dam site and the broader Taroom area carry significant historical trauma related to First Nations displacement. The chronology includes:

- By 1910, approximately 100 dispossessed Aboriginal people were camped around Taroom township
- In 1911, the Queensland Government established the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement, one of the early Aboriginal reserves run by the government
- In 1927, a government proposal for a dam at Nathan Gorge led to the forcible transfer of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement to Duaringa
- The settlement was significant as an early Aboriginal reserve providing a model for other Aboriginal settlements in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia

This history means the Nathan Dam proposal carries particular cultural sensitivity, as the same location that prompted displacement nearly a century ago has been repeatedly proposed for dam development.

#### Protection Measures

Cultural heritage management plans were developed as part of the EIS approval process. These plans would guide management of cultural heritage values if the project were to proceed, including protocols for:

- Protection of identified cultural heritage sites
- Management of potential discoveries during construction
- Ongoing consultation with Traditional Owner groups
- Preservation of cultural heritage values in the project area

#### Ongoing Relationship

As the project has not proceeded beyond the approval phase and is currently on hold, ongoing relationships with Traditional Owner groups regarding the project have not been actively maintained. Any future revival of the project would require renewed cultural heritage assessment and consultation processes, particularly given that the EIS expired in 2021.

### Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

#### Required Approvals

The Nathan Dam and Pipelines Project required multiple approvals across federal and state jurisdictions:

- **Federal EPBC Act Approval:** Required due to potential impacts on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, a matter of national environmental significance
- **Queensland Coordinator-General Assessment:** Required as a coordinated project under Queensland's development framework
- **Water Resource Plan Amendments:** Required to allocate water from the Dawson River system
- **Cultural Heritage Approvals:** Required under Queensland's Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Heritage Act
- **Planning and Development Approvals:** Required under Queensland planning legislation
- **Environmental Approvals:** Required for construction and operation under Queensland environmental legislation

#### Approval Status

- **Coordinator-General's Evaluation Report:** Released 31 May 2017, recommending the project proceed subject to conditions
- **Federal EPBC Act Approval:** Granted 13 July 2017 by the Federal Minister for the Environment and Energy
- **EIS Status:** Expired June 2021
- **Current Status:** All approvals have lapsed or would require renewal; project would need to restart assessment processes to proceed

#### Regulatory Bodies

Multiple agencies were involved in the approval and assessment processes:

- **Queensland Coordinator-General:** Led the state assessment process and issued the evaluation report
- **Australian Government Department of the Environment:** Responsible for EPBC Act assessment and approval
- **Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority:** Provided advice on potential impacts to the Great Barrier Reef
- **Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection:** Involved in water quality and environmental management aspects
- **Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines:** Involved in water allocation and resource management
- **Australian Competition and Consumer Commission:** Provided authorisation for collective negotiation by coal producers

#### Approval Timeline

- 2002: Initial federal approval application by Sudaw Developments Limited
- 2003: Federal Court challenge to approval process (Queensland Conservation Council v Minister)
- 2004: Full Federal Court appeal upheld requirement for broad consideration of impacts
- 2012: EIS finalised and released for public comment
- 2012: ACCC interim authorisation granted (November)
- 2013: ACCC final authorisation granted (February)
- 2016: Additional Environmental Impact Statement released
- 2017: Coordinator-General's evaluation report (31 May)
- 2017: Federal EPBC Act approval granted (13 July)
- 2021: EIS expired (June)

#### Conditions

The federal EPBC Act approval granted in July 2017 included significant conditions:

- **Restrictions on Agricultural Water Allocations:** The approval included restrictions on new water allocations for agriculture, directly addressing concerns about agricultural runoff and pollution impacts on the Great Barrier Reef. This condition reflected the outcome of the earlier legal challenges regarding indirect impacts.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Requirements for monitoring environmental flows, water quality and ecosystem health
- **Reporting Obligations:** Regular reporting to federal and state authorities on environmental compliance
- **Cultural Heritage:** Compliance with cultural heritage management plans

The Coordinator-General's evaluation report also included recommended conditions, though the specific details have not been widely publicized.

#### Compliance Requirements

As the project has not proceeded to construction, compliance and monitoring requirements have not been activated. If the project were to be revived, it would require:

- Renewal of the Environmental Impact Statement (expired 2021)
- Updated environmental assessments reflecting current conditions and regulatory frameworks
- Renewed consultation with stakeholders, including Traditional Owners, environmental groups, and affected communities
- Updated business case and commercial feasibility assessment
- Demonstration of sufficient water demand to justify the project

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The Nathan Dam and Pipelines Project sits within the Fitzroy Basin water planning framework, specifically the Dawson Valley water plan area. The Dawson River is a major tributary of the Fitzroy River, which flows to the Great Barrier Reef.

The 2006 Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy identified Nathan Dam as the preferred short to medium-term water supply solution for the Dawson-Callide sub-region, reflecting the project's integration into regional water planning at that time.

However, the project's relationship to water allocation frameworks has been contentious. A prolonged moratorium on irrigation permits was in place from the early 1990s in anticipation of the Nathan Dam development, creating tension with local agricultural producers seeking water access from the Dawson River.

#### Regional Development

The project was closely linked to resource sector development in the Surat and Bowen Basins. The coal seam gas and coal mining industries in these regions require significant water supplies for operations. The ACCC authorisation process in 2012-2013, involving six major coal producers, reflected the mining sector's interest in securing water supplies through the project.

The project was also promoted as supporting broader regional economic development in Central Queensland through:

- Job creation during construction and operation
- Water security enabling expansion of existing industries
- Potential for new irrigation agriculture development
- Infrastructure investment in the region

However, changing economic conditions in the coal sector and reduced water demand forecasts have undermined the project's regional development rationale.

#### Water Security

Water security for the Surat Basin mining sector and the Dawson-Callide region was a primary driver for the project. The dam would have provided:

- Reliable water supplies for coal and coal seam gas operations
- Drought security for existing water users
- Capacity for future growth in water demand
- Alternative to reliance on groundwater resources

However, market research has indicated that current and projected water demand is insufficient to justify the project. Alternative water sources and reduced industry water requirements have diminished the water security imperative that originally drove the proposal.

Recent interest from Toowoomba Regional Council in 2025 suggests potential for the project to serve urban water security objectives through a regional raw water supply scheme, representing a shift in the project's water security focus.

#### Stakeholder Support

Stakeholder positions on the Nathan Dam have been diverse and have evolved over time:

**Support:**
- Coal producers in Surat and Bowen Basins (2012-2013 ACCC authorisation period)
- Western Downs Regional Council (ongoing advocacy)
- Toowoomba Regional Council (2025 renewed interest in feasibility study)
- Some regional development advocates

**Opposition or Concern:**
- Environmental groups, including Queensland Conservation Council and WWF-Australia (led federal court challenge)
- Environmental Defenders Office (provided legal support for environmental challenges)
- Great Barrier Reef conservation advocates
- Some local agricultural producers concerned about water allocation impacts and potential flooding of agricultural land
- Taroom farmers seeking direct water access rather than dam development

#### Regional Benefits

Claimed regional benefits have included:

- Water security for mining sector employment and economic activity
- Potential expansion of irrigation agriculture (though restricted under 2017 federal approval)
- Construction employment and economic activity
- Regional infrastructure investment
- Potential flood mitigation for Theodore and other downstream communities

However, these benefits have not been sufficient to overcome commercial viability challenges, with insufficient water demand identified as a key barrier to the project proceeding.

#### Integration with Other Projects

The Nathan Dam has been considered in the context of broader water infrastructure planning in Queensland:

- Part of the 2006 Central Queensland Regional Water Supply Strategy
- Considered alongside other proposed Fitzroy Basin developments
- Pipeline infrastructure could potentially integrate with broader water distribution networks
- 2025 interest from Toowoomba Regional Council suggests potential integration with urban water supply systems
- Alternative proposal for a smaller Nathan Weir represents a scaled-back version of the original concept

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

The Nathan Dam project offers several important lessons for water infrastructure development in Australia:

1. **Environmental Assessment Scope:** The project was the subject of landmark litigation (Queensland Conservation Council v Minister, 2003-2004) that established the principle that environmental impact assessment under the EPBC Act must consider indirect and cumulative impacts. This precedent has shaped how federal environmental assessments are conducted for major projects, requiring consideration of the "whole, cumulated and continuing effect" of an activity rather than just direct impacts.

2. **Commercial Viability and Demand Uncertainty:** Despite receiving environmental approvals in 2017, the project has not proceeded due to insufficient water demand. This demonstrates that environmental and regulatory approvals alone do not ensure project viability. Robust demand assessment and commercial business cases are essential before investing in costly environmental assessment processes.

3. **Historical and Cultural Sensitivity:** The Nathan Gorge site has been repeatedly proposed for dam development since the 1920s, with the earlier proposal resulting in forced displacement of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement in 1927. This history demonstrates the importance of understanding and addressing historical injustices in infrastructure planning and the need for meaningful engagement with Traditional Owners.

4. **Changing Sectoral Demands:** The project's rationale shifted from irrigation agriculture (2002) to coal mining water supply (2007-2017) to potential urban water supply (2025). This evolution reflects changing regional economic conditions and highlights the challenge of planning large, inflexible infrastructure in contexts of economic uncertainty.

5. **Great Barrier Reef Protection:** The project demonstrated the increasing weight given to Great Barrier Reef protection in environmental decision-making, with federal approval in 2017 specifically restricting agricultural water allocations to address runoff concerns. This reflects growing recognition of cumulative pressures on the Reef and willingness to impose conditions on water infrastructure to protect it.

#### Best Practices

Elements of the assessment process that represented good practice include:

- Comprehensive environmental impact assessment including Additional EIS in response to stakeholder feedback
- Legal processes that clarified environmental assessment requirements for indirect impacts
- ACCC authorisation framework enabling efficient collective negotiation by water users
- Integration with regional water planning frameworks
- Cultural heritage assessment and management planning

#### Challenges

The project faced multiple challenges that prevented it from proceeding:

- **Environmental Concerns:** Significant concerns about impacts on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, requiring restrictions on agricultural water use
- **Commercial Viability:** Insufficient water demand from mining and other sectors despite initial interest from coal producers
- **Community Division:** Mixed support and opposition from different community groups and sectors
- **Changing Economic Conditions:** Reduced coal sector water requirements and changing regional economic conditions
- **Long Approval Timelines:** Extended periods between project conception, assessment, approval and potential implementation, during which market conditions changed
- **Historical Legacy:** Cultural sensitivity around a site previously associated with First Nations displacement

#### Legacy

The Nathan Dam project's legacy includes:

1. **Legal Precedent:** The Queensland Conservation Council case established enduring principles for environmental impact assessment of indirect and cumulative effects under the EPBC Act. This precedent continues to influence environmental assessment of major projects across Australia.

2. **Great Barrier Reef Protection:** The project contributed to evolving policy approaches to protecting the Great Barrier Reef from cumulative impacts, including greater scrutiny of water infrastructure and agricultural developments in reef catchments.

3. **Ongoing Regional Debate:** The project remains part of regional water infrastructure discussions in Central Queensland, with renewed interest in 2025 from regional councils, albeit with different rationales than the original mining-focused proposal.

4. **Incomplete Assessment:** Despite extensive environmental assessment and approvals, the project's business case was never completed, and no funding was committed. This represents significant investment in assessment processes for a project that did not proceed.

5. **Influence on Water Planning:** The project influenced water allocation policy in the Dawson Valley, including the prolonged irrigation moratorium that created tensions with local agricultural producers.

#### Comparable Projects

The Nathan Dam can be compared to several other Queensland water infrastructure proposals:

- **Urannah Dam:** Another proposed major dam that has progressed through various stages of assessment but not to construction
- **Hell's Gates Dam:** Proposed Fitzroy River dam that has received federal funding commitments for feasibility studies
- **Emu Swamp Dam:** A smaller dam project that has progressed to construction
- **Paradise Dam:** An existing dam that faced cost overruns and later structural concerns requiring modification

These comparisons highlight common challenges in Queensland water infrastructure development, including environmental assessment complexity, changing demand conditions, and difficulties in securing commercial viability.

#### Future Implications

The Nathan Dam experience has implications for future water infrastructure planning:

1. **Demand Assessment:** Projects require robust, conservative demand assessment before committing to expensive environmental assessment and approval processes
2. **Flexibility:** Large, single-purpose infrastructure may be less viable than flexible, staged approaches that can adapt to changing conditions
3. **Environmental Standards:** Future projects in Great Barrier Reef catchments will face high environmental assessment standards and may require significant restrictions to address reef protection concerns
4. **Alternative Approaches:** The evolution from full-scale dam to smaller weir proposals, and from irrigation/mining focus to urban water supply, suggests future approaches may favour smaller, more targeted interventions
5. **Community Engagement:** Effective engagement with diverse stakeholders, including Traditional Owners, environmental groups, and affected communities, is essential from the earliest stages of project conception
6. **Business Case First:** Environmental assessment should follow, not precede, robust commercial and economic analysis demonstrating project viability

The Nathan Dam remains a significant case study in Australian water infrastructure planning, demonstrating the complex interplay of environmental protection, commercial viability, cultural heritage, and changing regional development priorities in large infrastructure decision-making.
