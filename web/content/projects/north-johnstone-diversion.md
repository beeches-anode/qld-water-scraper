## Detailed Information

### Project Overview

The North Johnstone Diversion is a proposed water infrastructure project that would transfer water from the North Johnstone River to Lake Tinaroo (also known as Tinaroo Falls Dam) via pipeline to boost water supply for the Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation area in Far North Queensland. The project aims to redirect unallocated water from the river to supplement the storage that serves one of Queensland's most productive agricultural regions.

The project was proposed to address water security needs in the Tablelands region, which supports over 17,000 hectares of farmland producing a diverse range of crops including mangoes, avocados, bananas, coffee, tea trees, vegetables, and sugarcane. With climate variability and growing agricultural demand, additional water supply is seen as critical to maintaining and expanding the region's role as a significant food bowl for Queensland.

Key stakeholders include:
- **Sunwater** - water infrastructure operator that manages Tinaroo Falls Dam and the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme
- **Queensland Government** - through the Department of Local Government, Water and Volunteers, which conducted the Tablelands Regional Water Assessment
- **Advance Cairns** - regional advocacy organization promoting the project
- **Tablelands Regional Council, Mareeba Shire Council, and Cairns Regional Council** - local government stakeholders
- **Agricultural sector** - irrigators and growers in the Mareeba-Dimbulah scheme
- **Traditional Owners** - Aboriginal Rainforest People of the Wet Tropics
- **Environmental stakeholders** - given the project's location in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and Great Barrier Reef catchment

The project represents a potential alternative to new dam construction, utilizing unallocated flows from a high-rainfall catchment to supplement an existing irrigation scheme. However, it raises significant environmental and regulatory challenges due to its location within World Heritage Areas and the inter-catchment water transfer.

### Key Specifications

  - Estimated water transfer: 11,400 ML annually (conservative estimate based on $115-150m cost)
  - Alternative estimate: Up to 50,000 ML annually (from Sunwater preliminary feasibility study)
  - Historical note: An earlier concept proposed 176,000 ML per year (with minimum 141,000 ML no-fail yield) from three dams on Beatrice River, Dirran Creek, and headwaters of North Johnstone River

- **Infrastructure Components:**
  - Pipeline from North Johnstone River to Lake Tinaroo
  - Water extraction infrastructure on North Johnstone River
  - Intake and pumping facilities
  - Pipeline length and route not yet specified (to be determined in business case)
  - Integration with existing Tinaroo Falls Dam and Mareeba-Dimbulah distribution system

- **Design Features:**
  - Details to be determined through business case and detailed design
  - Will need to address elevation differences between source and destination
  - Must incorporate environmental flow protection measures

- **Operational Parameters:**
  - Will extract unallocated water from North Johnstone River
  - Must maintain environmental flows in source catchment
  - Water will be stored in Lake Tinaroo for distribution through existing Mareeba-Dimbulah scheme
  - Lake Tinaroo water is distributed by gravity through 176 km of main channel with 189 km of subsidiary channels to farms, dwellings and townships

### Project History and Status

#### Early Concepts

The idea of diverting water from the Johnstone River system to the Tablelands has been discussed for many years. Historical proposals included more ambitious schemes involving multiple dams on the Beatrice River, Dirran Creek, and headwaters of the North Johnstone River, with proposed transfers of 176,000 ML per year. These earlier iterations failed to progress past preliminary assessment stages.

#### Preliminary Feasibility (2020)

In early 2020, Sunwater completed a preliminary feasibility study on the North Johnstone Diversion with favorable findings. This study suggested the diversion could deliver up to 50,000 ML annually into Lake Tinaroo, providing a more realistic technical and economic assessment than previous concepts.

#### Regional Water Assessment Program (2021-2024)

The Queensland Government launched the Regional Water Assessment Program in 2021, investing $9 million to assess water infrastructure opportunities in three regions, including the Tablelands. The Tablelands RWA began in late 2021 and involved extensive stakeholder consultation to identify and evaluate potential water supply and security initiatives.

Through this process, stakeholders identified 113 potential water supply options for the Tablelands region. The North Johnstone Diversion was one of these 113 options and underwent technical analysis alongside extensive stakeholder feedback.

#### Draft RWA and Prioritization (2023)

In July 2023, the draft Tablelands Regional Water Assessment was released, identifying the North Johnstone Diversion as one of the key projects for action. The draft proposed that the Johnstone River to Tinaroo Falls Dam Pipeline proceed to a business case, subject to conditions and compatibility requirements.

However, the draft RWA placed the project in a long-term priority category (target completion in 10 years and beyond) rather than in the short-term (within 2 years) or medium-term (2-5 years) action lists. This reflected the significant regulatory and environmental challenges associated with the project.

Public consultation on the draft RWA was conducted in mid-2023, closing in late July 2023.

#### Final RWA (2024)

The feedback from public consultation was incorporated into an updated Regional Water Assessment. The final Tablelands RWA was expected to be released by September 30, 2024, though confirmation of release and final contents are not yet publicly documented as of this writing.

The final RWA confirmed the project as worthy of further investigation but maintained the long-term priority classification, indicating that if the Queensland Government adopts the 10+ year timeline, there would be significant delay before the project could proceed.

#### Current Status

As of late 2024, the North Johnstone Diversion remains in the planning stage:
- Preliminary feasibility has been completed with favorable findings
- The project is recognized in the Tablelands RWA as a priority for further investigation
- No funding has been committed for the detailed business case
- Advance Cairns and regional stakeholders are seeking a $7 million investment for a full business case
- Detailed business cases typically take up to two years to complete
- Following business case completion, the project would need to secure government funding and obtain environmental approvals before construction could commence

The project is noted as requiring bilateral commitment and shared investment to facilitate environmental approvals and progress to construction stage.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Setting

The North Johnstone River is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, one of the most biodiverse regions in Australia. The catchment experiences very high rainfall ranging from 1,800mm to 4,000mm per year, resulting in an average annual freshwater outflow of 3 million megalitres to the Great Barrier Reef. The river supports significant aquatic ecosystems and provides critical flows to downstream estuarine and coastal environments.

There are no dams or reservoirs in the Johnstone River catchment, and the river maintains a relatively natural flow regime, though water is extracted for town water supply, dairy farming, and sugarcane production.

#### Water Quality Considerations

Research has documented that agricultural practices in the Johnstone River catchment have impacted water quality:

- Total phosphate concentrations in channel sediments show substantial increases from rainforest to agricultural settings
- Inorganic phosphate concentrations are much higher in tributaries draining agricultural land
- Introduction of agriculture has transformed suspended sediment and nutrient dynamics
- Grazing has led to soil erosion and increased suspended sediment and particulate nutrient concentrations
- Fertilized cropping has increased nutrient inputs to catchments, increasing both particulate and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations

However, research also suggests that phosphate loss from agricultural land in the Johnstone Rivers catchment is unlikely to significantly affect the nutrient status of the Great Barrier Reef, based on estuarine, offshore, and reef sediment data.

#### Potential Environmental Impacts

The North Johnstone Diversion project could have several environmental implications:

- **Flow Reduction:** Extracting water from the North Johnstone River would reduce downstream flows, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystems, estuarine environments, and coastal receiving waters
- **Ecosystem Dependencies:** Species and ecosystems adapted to natural flow regimes may be affected by altered flow patterns
- **Inter-catchment Transfer:** Moving water from the Wet Tropics catchment to the Barron River catchment raises ecological considerations regarding species movement and biosecurity
- **World Heritage Values:** Impacts must be assessed against World Heritage criteria and protections
- **Great Barrier Reef Catchment:** Changes to freshwater flows to the reef must be evaluated against reef health objectives

#### Environmental Benefits

Proponents note potential environmental benefits:

- Utilizes unallocated flows from a high-rainfall catchment
- Avoids need for new dam construction with associated inundation impacts
- May support improved agricultural water use efficiency when combined with recent Mareeba-Dimbulah efficiency improvements

#### Mitigation Strategies

Specific mitigation strategies will be developed through the environmental assessment process, but likely measures include:

- Environmental flow requirements to protect downstream ecosystems
- Water quality monitoring programs
- Adaptive management frameworks
- Offset programs if required
- Biosecurity measures to prevent species transfer between catchments
- Integration with broader catchment water quality improvement programs

#### Regulatory Requirements

The project will require comprehensive environmental assessment including:

- Federal environmental approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act) due to World Heritage Area impacts
- Queensland environmental assessment under state legislation
- Alignment with Wet Tropics water resource plan
- Alignment with Barron River water resource plan
- Consideration of Great Barrier Reef water quality targets
- Likely requirement for full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owners and Cultural Significance

The Aboriginal Rainforest People of the Wet Tropics of Queensland have lived continuously in the rainforest environment for at least 5,000 years. On 9 November 2012, the Australian Government announced the recognition of the national Indigenous heritage values as part of the existing National Heritage Listing for the Wet Tropics of Queensland.

Historical accounts provide evidence of extensive Indigenous land management in the North Johnstone River area. In 1873, George Augustus Frederick Dalrymple encountered a large village along the North Johnstone River with "a riot of palms, bananas, ferns and lilies descended to the waters edge, and large-leafed taro grew in strips along the riverbank over tens of hectares," with "rows of neatly made bark and palm leaf huts" and "dappled paths led to managed patches of open forest, groves of fruit trees, bananas and yams."

This description, sometimes characterized as "ecology on steroids," demonstrates sophisticated land and water management practices that sustained Indigenous communities in the region for thousands of years.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

Formal cultural heritage assessment for the North Johnstone Diversion project has not yet commenced. The specific Traditional Owner groups with rights and interests in the North Johnstone River area will need to be formally identified and engaged during the business case development phase.

The project area falls within the broader Wet Tropics region, which is home to multiple First Nations groups. Consultation will need to identify which specific groups have cultural connections to the project footprint, including both the water source area and the pipeline corridor.

#### Consultation Requirements

The project will require comprehensive consultation with Traditional Owners, including:

- Identification of relevant Traditional Owner groups
- Cultural heritage surveys and assessments
- Protection of identified cultural heritage sites
- Consultation on impacts to cultural values including water, land, and spiritual connections
- Potential development of Indigenous Land Use Agreements or Cultural Heritage Management Plans
- Ongoing involvement in project planning, implementation, and monitoring

#### Protection Measures

Specific protection measures will be determined through consultation and assessment, but are likely to include:

- Cultural heritage surveys prior to construction
- Protection protocols for identified sites
- Traditional Owner involvement in project monitoring
- Potential employment and contracting opportunities for Traditional Owner groups
- Integration of Indigenous knowledge in environmental management
- Respect for cultural protocols regarding water and land

The Wet Tropics World Heritage Area has specific requirements for cultural heritage protection that will apply to this project.

The project description notes that bilateral commitment and shared investment will be required to facilitate environmental approvals and progress to construction stage, indicating that government support will be necessary to navigate the complex regulatory pathway.

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The North Johnstone Diversion presents unique water planning challenges as it involves transfer between two separate water plan areas:

**Wet Tropics Water Plan (source):**
- The North Johnstone River is subject to the Wet Tropics water resource plan
- Extraction of water must be consistent with plan allocations and environmental flow objectives
- The project would utilize unallocated water from the system
- Any extraction must maintain World Heritage Area values

**Barron River Water Plan (destination):**
- Lake Tinaroo is part of the Barron River water resource plan area
- Additional water must be integrated into existing allocation framework
- May require plan amendments to accommodate additional water source
- Must be consistent with environmental flow objectives for Barron River downstream of Tinaroo Falls Dam

The project will need to demonstrate compatibility with both water plans and potentially require amendments to one or both plans to facilitate the inter-catchment transfer.

#### Regional Development Context

The Tablelands region is considered one of Queensland's most significant food bowls, with over 17,000 hectares of farmland supporting diverse agricultural production. The region has recently benefited from major water infrastructure improvements:

**Mareeba-Dimbulah Irrigation Efficiency Project:**
- Completed in 2024
- Delivered 38% increase in water available to irrigators (additional 11,500 ML)
- Replaced and installed 14 km of pipeline
- Installed 125 automated control gates in irrigation channels
- Upgraded 157 water offtakes
- Expected to deliver $20+ million per year in increased agricultural production

The North Johnstone Diversion would complement these efficiency improvements by providing additional water supply to support continued agricultural growth and diversification in the region.

#### Water Security

The project addresses water security concerns for the Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation area:

- Tinaroo Falls Dam and Lake Tinaroo are the primary water source for the scheme

**Influence on Water Planning:**
The project's inclusion in the Tablelands RWA establishes it as a recognized option for future water supply in the region. Even if not immediately progressed, the concept remains available for reconsideration if circumstances change (e.g., drought, agricultural expansion, or technology advances).

**Inter-catchment Transfer Precedent:**
If progressed, the project would establish important precedents for inter-catchment water transfers in Queensland, including approaches to environmental assessment, cultural heritage management, and water resource plan integration.

**World Heritage Area Water Projects:**
The project will test regulatory approaches to water infrastructure in World Heritage Areas, potentially informing future projects in similar contexts across Australia.

**Agricultural Water Security:**
Success or failure of the project will influence approaches to agricultural water security in high-value horticultural regions, including the balance between efficiency improvements, demand management, and new supply augmentation.

#### Comparable Projects

The North Johnstone Diversion can be compared to several other Queensland water infrastructure projects:

**Paradise Dam Spillway Lowering:**
- Similar complexity around environmental and engineering trade-offs
- Controversial decisions about water supply versus risk management
- Demonstrates challenges of major water infrastructure changes

**Burdekin Falls Dam and Hells Gates Dam (proposed):**
- Large-scale water supply projects for agricultural development
- Similar regional development objectives
- Different environmental contexts but comparable regulatory pathways

**South West Pipeline:**
- Major pipeline project demonstrating technical feasibility of long-distance water transfer
- Different purpose (urban water supply) but comparable infrastructure type

**Nullinga Dam (proposed):**
- Similarly identified through regional water assessments
- Similar long-term priority classification
- Demonstrates extended timelines for new major water infrastructure

#### Future Implications

The North Johnstone Diversion project has several implications for future water infrastructure planning in Queensland:

**Regional Assessment Model:**
The RWA process that identified this project may be replicated in other regions, providing a systematic approach to identifying and prioritizing water infrastructure options.

**Unallocated Water Utilization:**
If successful, the project could encourage similar proposals to utilize unallocated flows from high-rainfall catchments to supplement supply in agricultural regions.

**Environmental Standards:**
The project's progression (or lack thereof) will signal the stringency of environmental assessment requirements for projects affecting World Heritage Areas and reef catchments.

**Business Case Requirements:**
The $7 million business case cost (if funded) will establish benchmarks for the level of assessment required for complex inter-catchment transfer projects.

**Long-term Planning:**
The 10+ year timeline demonstrates the need for long-term water infrastructure planning in Queensland, with projects potentially requiring decades from concept to commissioning.

The North Johnstone Diversion remains a significant potential option for enhancing water security in Far North Queensland's premier agricultural region, but faces a lengthy and complex path toward potential implementation. Its progression will depend on securing business case funding, navigating environmental and cultural heritage requirements, demonstrating economic viability, and maintaining political support over an extended timeline.
