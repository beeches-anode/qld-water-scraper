## Project Overview

The North Johnstone Diversion proposes to transfer water from the North Johnstone River via pipeline to Lake Tinaroo (Tinaroo Falls Dam), supplementing supply for the Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation area. The concept aims to redirect unallocated water from the high-rainfall Wet Tropics catchment to support one of Queensland's most productive agricultural regions.

In early 2020, Sunwater completed a preliminary feasibility study with favorable findings, suggesting the diversion could deliver up to 50,000 ML annually into Lake Tinaroo. The project was subsequently included in the Tablelands Regional Water Assessment, which evaluated 113 potential water supply options through technical analysis and stakeholder consultation.

The July 2023 draft Tablelands RWA identified the North Johnstone Diversion as worthy of proceeding to a business case, but classified it as a long-term priority (10+ years) rather than short-term or medium-term action. This classification reflects the significant environmental and regulatory complexity of a project affecting a World Heritage Area and involving inter-catchment transfer.

## Project History

The idea of diverting water from the Johnstone River system to the Tablelands has been discussed for decades. Earlier proposals included more ambitious schemes involving multiple dams on the Beatrice River, Dirran Creek, and North Johnstone River headwaters, with proposed transfers of 176,000 ML per year. These concepts failed to progress past preliminary assessment.

The current pipeline-based approach emerged from the Queensland Government's Regional Water Assessment Program, launched in 2021 with $9 million to assess water infrastructure opportunities in three regions including the Tablelands. Through extensive consultation beginning late 2021, stakeholders identified 113 potential options for the region.

Public consultation on the draft RWA closed in late July 2023. The final Tablelands RWA was released in 2024, maintaining the project's long-term priority classification while confirming it merits further investigation through a detailed business case.

## Environmental Considerations

The North Johnstone River is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, experiencing 1,800-4,000mm annual rainfall with average freshwater outflow of 3 million megalitres to the Great Barrier Reef. There are no dams in the Johnstone River catchment, and the river maintains a relatively natural flow regime.

Research documented in the Johnstone River Basin Environmental Values report shows agricultural practices have impacted water quality, with increased phosphate concentrations in tributaries draining agricultural land. However, the same research suggests phosphate loss from agricultural land in the Johnstone Rivers catchment is unlikely to significantly affect the nutrient status of the Great Barrier Reef based on estuarine and offshore sediment data.

The project would require federal environmental approval under the EPBC Act for World Heritage Area impacts, Queensland environmental approvals, and amendments to water resource plans for both the Wet Tropics and Barron River catchments. Environmental flow requirements to protect downstream ecosystems would be a key consideration.

## Cultural Heritage

The Aboriginal Rainforest People of the Wet Tropics have lived continuously in the rainforest environment for at least 5,000 years. On 9 November 2012, the Australian Government recognised national Indigenous heritage values as part of the existing National Heritage Listing for the Wet Tropics of Queensland.

Historical accounts from 1873 describe extensive Indigenous land management along the North Johnstone River, including managed forest patches, fruit tree groves, and agricultural areas with "rows of neatly made bark and palm leaf huts" and "dappled paths led to managed patches of open forest, groves of fruit trees, bananas and yams."

Formal cultural heritage assessment has not commenced. Specific Traditional Owner groups with rights and interests in the project area will need to be identified and engaged during business case development, with consultation required on impacts to cultural values including water, land, and spiritual connections.

## Regional Context

The project would complement the recently completed Mareeba-Dimbulah Irrigation Efficiency Project, which delivered a 38% increase in water available to irrigators (additional 11,500 ML) through 14 km of new pipeline, 125 automated control gates, and 157 upgraded water offtakes.

Lake Tinaroo water is currently distributed by gravity through 176 km of main channel with 189 km of subsidiary channels to farms, dwellings, and townships. Additional supply from the North Johnstone Diversion would integrate with this existing distribution infrastructure.

The project requires bilateral commitment between federal and state governments to navigate the complex approvals pathway. Advance Cairns and regional stakeholders are seeking $7 million for a detailed business case, which would typically take up to two years to complete before the project could enter formal approvals processes.
