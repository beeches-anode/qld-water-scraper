## Project Overview

Nullinga Dam was a proposed water storage facility on the Walsh River in Far North Queensland, first conceived in the 1950s when Tinaroo Falls Dam was built instead as the more economically favorable option. The project was reconsidered in the 2010s to address anticipated urban water demand growth in Cairns and agricultural expansion opportunities in the Mareeba Dimbulah region.

Building Queensland led development of both a preliminary business case (2017) and detailed business case (2019) in partnership with Sunwater. The project aimed to supplement the existing Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme and provide additional allocations for agricultural and urban use. MSF Sugar emerged as a major potential customer, stating their expansion plans required 120,000 ML of additional water for sugarcane production.

The detailed business case revealed fundamental economic challenges: water would cost upward of $15,900 per megalitre to produce, while customers indicated willingness to pay only $2,000-$3,000 per megalitre. The Walsh River catchment was identified as a poor-performing water source with limited and unreliable yield, requiring costly infrastructure relative to the water volume available.

## Project History

The dam was first proposed in the 1950s but Tinaroo Falls Dam was selected as the preferred option at that time. The concept remained dormant for decades until Building Queensland completed a preliminary business case in 2017, estimating delivery costs at $330 million.

Following public release of the preliminary business case in February 2018, Building Queensland conducted a Request for Information process to assess water demand. During this period, cost estimates escalated significantly. The detailed business case completed in June 2019 revealed costs had nearly tripled to $975 million.

On 2 August 2019, Queensland Natural Resources Minister Dr Anthony Lynham announced the project would not proceed. In his statement, Dr Lynham said the business case showed "water would cost five to six times more than any prospective water users could pay." The government decided to protect the dam site for potential future consideration while pursuing alternative water supply options.

Rather than investing in new infrastructure, the Queensland Government subsequently funded the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project, completed in December 2021 with $32.54 million investment. This achieved water savings of up to 8,306 megalitres per year through infrastructure upgrades.

## Environmental Considerations

The Walsh River catchment drains to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, making water quality and flow considerations particularly important. The business case identified the catchment as poor-performing for dam development due to limited and unreliable water yield and seasonal flow variability.

No comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was prepared as the project did not proceed past the business case stage. Had the project advanced, assessment would have been required for potential impacts on downstream water flows, Great Barrier Reef water quality, and Wet Tropics World Heritage Area values.

## Cultural Heritage

The Bar-Barrum people hold Native Title rights over land and waters on the Atherton Tablelands in and around the Walsh River area where Nullinga Dam was proposed. No detailed Cultural Heritage Impact Assessment was conducted as the project did not proceed beyond the business case phase, and formal consultation with Traditional Owners about cultural heritage impacts did not occur.

## Regional Context

The Nullinga Dam proposal was considered within broader Far North Queensland water infrastructure planning. The Walsh River is part of the Gulf water resource planning area, and the dam would have supplemented the existing Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme supplied by Tinaroo Falls Dam.

The project's discontinuation highlighted challenges in delivering economically viable water infrastructure in northern Australia, where catchment performance is often seasonal and unreliable. The decision to invest instead in efficiency improvements to the existing Mareeba Dimbulah scheme demonstrated an alternative approach to addressing regional water needs at significantly lower cost.
