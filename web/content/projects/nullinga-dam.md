## Detailed Information

## Project Overview

Nullinga Dam was a proposed water storage facility on the Walsh River in Far North Queensland, first conceived in the 1950s. At that time, Tinaroo Falls Dam was built instead as the more economically favorable option. The project was reconsidered in the 2010s as part of broader water infrastructure planning for Far North Queensland, driven by anticipated urban water demand growth in Cairns and agricultural expansion opportunities in the Mareeba Dimbulah region.

Building Queensland led the development of both a preliminary business case (completed 2017) and a detailed business case (completed June 2019) in partnership with Sunwater, the state-owned water infrastructure provider. The project aimed to supplement the existing Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme and provide additional allocations for both agricultural and urban use.

Key stakeholders included the Queensland Government (through Building Queensland and Department of State Development), Sunwater, Mareeba Shire Council, MSF Sugar (a major sugar producer seeking water for expansion), and other agricultural interests in the region. The project was positioned as a potential catalyst for regional economic development through agricultural intensification and improved water security for Cairns.

The project site is located on the Walsh River, approximately 24 kilometres south-west of Mareeba and 55 kilometres south-west of Cairns, on the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland.

## Key Specifications

- **Capacity/Scale:**
  - Indicated storage capacity: 365,000 megalitres
  - Potential enhanced capacity: Additional 126,000 megalitres with enhanced design options focused on larger dam wall
  - Estimated yield: Between 55,000 and 88,000 megalitres of medium priority water allocations

- **Infrastructure Components:**
  - Main dam wall on Walsh River
  - Associated water distribution infrastructure to connect with Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme
  - Specific engineering details not developed as project discontinued at business case stage

- **Design Features:**
  - Multiple size options considered (smaller and larger dam configurations)
  - Both options analyzed in detailed business case
  - Detailed design not undertaken as project deemed unviable

- **Operational Parameters:**
  - Intended to provide medium priority water allocations
  - Would integrate with existing Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme
  - Operational framework not finalized as project discontinued

## Project History and Status

### 1950s Origins

Nullinga Dam was first proposed in the 1950s as a water storage option for Far North Queensland. However, at that time, Tinaroo Falls Dam was identified as the more favorable option and was constructed instead. The Nullinga Dam concept remained dormant for several decades.

### 2017 Preliminary Business Case

Building Queensland completed the Nullinga Dam and Other Options Preliminary Business Case in 2017. At this stage, the estimated cost of delivery was $330 million. The preliminary business case investigated the potential for Nullinga Dam and other options to address an identified future water supply shortfall to service growing urban demand in Cairns and to stimulate irrigated agriculture in the region by supplementing existing supplies.

The preliminary business case recommended:
- Further analysis of improvements to the existing Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme
- If a satisfactory level of demand was confirmed, further investigation of Nullinga Dam construction

### 2018 Public Release and Demand Assessment

In February 2018, the Preliminary Business Case was publicly released. Building Queensland initiated a Request for Information process to assess water demand from potential users, which closed in August 2018.

During this period, MSF Sugar emerged as a major potential customer, advising Building Queensland that their expansion plans required 120,000 ML of additional water for sugarcane production - significantly higher than initial demand estimates. MSF Sugar's General Manager Agriculture Trevor Crook stated that the preliminary business case's estimate of 72,000 ML of potential demand "fails to incorporate information submitted to Building Queensland that outlines the company's expected demand for water."

MSF Sugar chief executive Mike Barry publicly stated the company was "happy to support and underwrite" the project because it was "vital" to their Tablelands expansion plans, including potential development of an ethanol distillery.

This period also saw confusion and concern in the agricultural sector about the project's direction, with MSF Sugar stating that "Confusion Around Nullinga Dam Undermines Business Confidence."

### 2019 Detailed Business Case

Building Queensland completed the detailed business case in June 2019, with public release in August 2019. The cost estimate had escalated significantly to up to $975 million, more than double the preliminary business case estimate. This escalation prompted questions from Advance Cairns CEO Nick Trompf about the cost analysis methodology.

The detailed business case undertook comprehensive financial and economic analysis, including:
- Financial modeling by NineSquared incorporating Net Present Value calculations over 30-year and 50-year periods
- Economic analysis peer-reviewed by Synergies Economic Consulting
- Assessment of both smaller and larger dam configuration options
- Detailed demand and pricing analysis

### Key Findings - Economic Unviability

The business case analysis revealed that construction of the proposed Nullinga Dam was neither financially nor economically viable. Both the smaller and larger dam options "would result in poor economic returns and poor financial outcomes."

Critical findings included:
- Water would cost upward from $15,900 per megalitre to produce
- Customers indicated willingness and capacity to pay only around $2,000-$3,000 per megalitre
- Water cost would be 5-6 times higher than prospective users could afford to pay
- The proposed dam site is located in a poor-performing catchment requiring a costly build solution
- To construct a dam meeting identified demand would require an extended and costly construction program relative to the limited volume of water that would be available
- Benefit-Cost Ratio below 1.0 (economically unviable)
- Negative Net Present Value

### August 2019 Government Decision

On August 2, 2019, Queensland Natural Resources Minister Dr Anthony Lynham announced the release of the detailed business case and the government's decision not to proceed with Nullinga Dam. In his statement, Dr Lynham said:

"The State Government will protect the proposed Nullinga Dam site and pursue alternative water supply options for the Far North. The business case says water would cost five to six times more than any prospective water users could pay."

The decision included:
- Project would not proceed
- Dam site would be reserved/protected for potential future consideration
- Alternative water supply options would be pursued for Far North Queensland development

### Stakeholder Reactions

The decision was met with mixed reactions:
- Agricultural sector skepticism about the economic analysis
- MSF Sugar disappointment as the project was central to expansion plans
- Recognition that water infrastructure challenges in Far North Queensland remained unresolved
- Questions about alternative water supply options for regional development

### Current Status

The Nullinga Dam project remains discontinued. The site is reserved for potential future reconsideration if circumstances change. The Queensland Government has focused on alternative water supply options, including improvements to the existing Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme.

In 2021, the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project was completed (separate to Nullinga Dam), with $32.54 million invested to upgrade infrastructure. Water losses across the scheme were reduced by up to 8,306 megalitres through these efficiency improvements.

## Financial Details

### Total Project Cost

- **Preliminary Business Case (2017):** Estimated delivery cost of $330 million
- **Detailed Business Case (2019):** Cost escalated to up to $975 million
- **Cost Escalation:** Nearly 200% increase from preliminary to detailed assessment, raising questions from stakeholders about methodology and assumptions

### Economic Analysis

The detailed business case undertook comprehensive economic analysis:

- **Net Present Value (NPV):** Negative across all scenarios analyzed (specific figures remain commercial-in-confidence)
- **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR):** Below 1.0, indicating the project would destroy economic value rather than create it
- **Analysis Timeframes:** Modeling conducted over both 30-year and 50-year periods
- **Result:** Both smaller and larger dam options would result in poor economic returns and poor financial outcomes

### Financial Viability Analysis

NineSquared conducted thorough financial analysis revealing critical viability challenges:

- **Cost of Water Production:** Upward of $15,900 per megalitre
- **Customer Willingness/Ability to Pay:** Approximately $2,000-$3,000 per megalitre
- **Cost-Price Gap:** Water would cost 5-6 times more than prospective users could afford
- **Implication:** No viable commercial model for water sales; massive subsidy would be required

### Catchment Performance Issues

A key driver of poor economics was the poor-performing catchment:
- Walsh River catchment has limited and unreliable water yield
- To achieve desired storage volumes and reliability would require very large, costly infrastructure
- Construction program would be extended and expensive relative to water volume available
- High capital cost per megalitre of reliable yield

### Funding Sources

- **Planned Funding:** Not determined as project did not proceed
- **Actual Funding:** None committed
- **Status:** Project discontinued before funding arrangements were finalized

### Alternative Investment - Mareeba Dimbulah Efficiency Improvements

Rather than investing $975 million in new infrastructure, the Queensland Government pursued efficiency improvements to existing infrastructure:
- **Investment:** $32.54 million in Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project
- **Completion:** December 2021
- **Outcome:** Water losses reduced by up to 8,306 megalitres per year
- **Cost Comparison:** Achieved significant water savings at approximately 3% of Nullinga Dam's estimated cost

## Environmental Considerations

### Catchment Context

The Walsh River is located in the Wet Tropics region of Far North Queensland, an area of high environmental and World Heritage significance. The catchment eventually drains to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, making water quality and flow considerations particularly important.

### Environmental Impact Assessment Status

No comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared for Nullinga Dam, as the project did not proceed past the business case stage. Consequently, detailed environmental impact analysis was not undertaken.

### Identified Environmental Challenges

**Poor-Performing Catchment:**
The business case identified the Walsh River as a poor-performing catchment for dam development. This environmental characteristic was a key factor in the project's economic unviability. The catchment has:
- Limited and unreliable water yield
- Seasonal flow variability
- Insufficient reliable runoff to justify large infrastructure investment

**Downstream Impacts:**
Dam construction would have altered natural flow regimes in the Walsh River, with potential consequences including:
- Reduced downstream water flows
- Changes to seasonal flow patterns important for aquatic ecosystems
- Potential impacts on aquatic species migration and reproduction
- Altered sediment transport dynamics

**Great Barrier Reef Water Quality:**
The Walsh River catchment drains to the Great Barrier Reef. While specific water quality impact assessments were not conducted, general concerns about dam impacts in the Wet Tropics region include:
- Altered nutrient and sediment delivery to downstream systems
- Changes in freshwater flow timing and volume reaching coastal waters
- Potential cumulative impacts on reef water quality when combined with other land use changes

**Wet Tropics Values:**
The location within or adjacent to the Wet Tropics region would have required consideration of:
- World Heritage Area values
- Biodiversity impacts on tropical rainforest ecosystems
- Impacts on endemic and threatened species
- Consistency with Wet Tropics management plans

### Regulatory Requirements Not Pursued

Had the project proceeded, it would have required:
- Environmental Impact Statement under Queensland legislation
- Potential assessment under Commonwealth EPBC Act if matters of national environmental significance were triggered
- Great Barrier Reef wetland protection area assessment
- Water quality impact assessment for Great Barrier Reef waters
- Aquatic ecosystem impact assessment
- Flora and fauna surveys and impact mitigation plans

### Environmental Benefits

No specific environmental benefits were claimed in the business case documentation. Unlike some water infrastructure projects that can claim environmental flow benefits or ecosystem restoration outcomes, Nullinga Dam was primarily justified on water supply grounds.

## First Nations and Cultural Heritage

### Traditional Owner Groups

**Bar-Barrum People:**
The Bar-Barrum people hold Native Title rights over land and waters on the Atherton Tablelands in and around the Walsh River area where Nullinga Dam was proposed. The Bar-Barrum people claim this area as traditional lands for customary residence, cultural, social, spiritual, and economic purposes.

The Walsh River and its catchment hold cultural and spiritual significance for the Bar-Barrum people, as water places are central to Aboriginal cultural heritage and ongoing connection to Country.

### Cultural Heritage Assessment Status

No detailed Cultural Heritage Impact Assessment (CHIA) was conducted for the Nullinga Dam project, as it did not proceed beyond the business case phase. Consequently:
- Specific cultural heritage sites within the proposed dam footprint and inundation area were not formally identified
- Consultation with Traditional Owners did not progress to detailed assessment phase
- Cultural heritage management plans were not developed
- Indigenous Land Use Agreements were not negotiated

### Consultation Process

Given the project's discontinuation at business case stage, formal consultation with the Bar-Barrum people about cultural heritage impacts did not occur. Had the project proceeded, consultation would have been required under:
- Queensland Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003
- Native Title Act 1993 (Commonwealth)
- Duty to consult protocols
- Cultural heritage management plan requirements

### Cultural Heritage Concerns

While specific concerns about Nullinga Dam were not formally documented, general cultural heritage considerations for dam projects in Far North Queensland include:
- Inundation of culturally significant sites and places
- Disruption of songlines and cultural pathways
- Impacts on story places connected to water
- Loss of access to traditional use areas
- Disturbance of burial sites or ceremonial grounds
- Changes to water flows affecting downstream cultural practices

The Djabugay people (traditional owners of the Barron River area to the north) have demonstrated the importance of protecting "storywater places" in their Country, illustrating the cultural significance of water systems to First Nations peoples in the region.

### Protection Measures

No cultural heritage protection measures were developed as the project did not proceed to planning or design phases.

### Future Considerations

If the Nullinga Dam site is reconsidered in the future, comprehensive cultural heritage assessment and meaningful consultation with the Bar-Barrum people would be essential early steps in any planning process.

## Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

### Required Approvals - Not Pursued

As the project did not proceed beyond business case stage, formal approvals were not sought. Had the project advanced, required approvals would have included:

**State Approvals (Queensland):**
- Environmental Impact Statement under State Development and Public Works Organisation Act or Environmental Protection Act
- Water allocation and resource planning approvals under Water Act 2000
- Cultural heritage approvals under Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003
- Planning and development approvals under relevant local government planning schemes
- Dam safety approvals under Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008

**Commonwealth Approvals:**
Potentially required if matters of national environmental significance triggered:
- Assessment under Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999
- Possible triggers: Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, threatened species, water resources

**Native Title:**
- Compliance with Native Title Act 1993
- Negotiation with Bar-Barrum people as Native Title holders
- Potential Indigenous Land Use Agreement

### Approval Status

- **Status:** Not sought
- **Reason:** Project discontinued at business case phase due to economic unviability

### Regulatory Bodies

Key regulatory agencies that would have been involved:
- Queensland Department of Environment and Science
- Queensland Department of Resources
- Queensland Department of State Development
- Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
- Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water (for EPBC matters)
- Mareeba Shire Council
- Sunwater (as water infrastructure provider)

### Compliance Requirements

Not developed as project discontinued.

## Regional Context

### Water Plan Integration

The Nullinga Dam proposal was considered within the context of:
- **Gulf Water Plan:** The Walsh River is part of the Gulf water resource planning area
- **Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme:** Nullinga Dam would have supplemented this existing scheme, which is supplied primarily by Tinaroo Falls Dam
- **Regional Water Supply Planning:** Part of broader Far North Queensland water infrastructure strategy

### Regional Development Context

**Far North Queensland Development Priorities:**
- Agricultural expansion and intensification, particularly sugar cane production
- Water security for Cairns urban growth
- Regional economic diversification
- Jobs creation in primary industries

**Mareeba Shire Economic Development:**
- Agriculture as primary economic driver
- Sugar production through MSF Sugar operations
- Potential for value-added agricultural processing (e.g., ethanol production)
- Tourism and diversified agriculture on Atherton Tablelands

### Water Security Challenges

Far North Queensland faces particular water security challenges:
- Seasonal rainfall variability
- Wet Tropics climate with distinct wet and dry seasons
- Agricultural water demand increasing with crop intensification
- Cairns urban growth projecting increased demand
- Limited economically viable water storage sites
- Environmental constraints in World Heritage areas

### Stakeholder Support and Opposition

**Supporters:**
- MSF Sugar (major potential customer requiring 120,000 ML for expansion)
- Agricultural sector seeking water for irrigation expansion
- Some regional development advocates seeing water infrastructure as catalyst for growth
- Mareeba Shire Council (supporting water security improvements)

**Concerns/Opposition:**
- Economic analysis showing unviability
- Environmental groups potentially concerned about Great Barrier Reef and Wet Tropics impacts (though project did not progress to formal opposition stage)
- Queensland Government determining alternative options preferable

### Regional Benefits - Intended but Not Realized

The project aimed to deliver:
- Support for MSF Sugar expansion and associated jobs
- Increased agricultural production value in Far North Queensland
- Improved water security for Cairns
- Regional economic multiplier effects through agricultural processing
- Infrastructure jobs during construction

These benefits were not realized due to project discontinuation.

### Integration with Other Projects

**Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project:**
Instead of new storage infrastructure, the Queensland Government invested in efficiency improvements to the existing scheme, delivering water savings at a fraction of Nullinga Dam's cost.

**Broader National Water Infrastructure Development Fund:**
Nullinga Dam was considered as part of broader Commonwealth and State water infrastructure planning under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund feasibility studies program.

## Lessons and Legacy

### Key Lessons

**Early Economic Analysis Critical:**
The Nullinga Dam case demonstrates the importance of rigorous economic analysis early in project development. The preliminary business case indicated potential viability, but detailed analysis revealed fundamental economic challenges. Early identification of catchment performance limitations and cost-price gaps could have prevented substantial investigation costs.

**Catchment Performance Fundamentals:**
Dam viability depends fundamentally on catchment hydrology. The Walsh River's poor performance as a water source - limited and unreliable yield - was an insurmountable challenge. This reinforces that water infrastructure location must be driven by hydrological suitability, not just demand location.

**Cost-Benefit Reality Check:**
Water infrastructure must produce water at a price customers can afford. A 5-6 times gap between production cost and customer capacity to pay indicates fundamental project unviability. Subsidized water infrastructure must be carefully justified against alternative uses of public funds.

**Demand Assessment Complexity:**
Significant variation between preliminary demand estimates (72,000 ML) and MSF Sugar's stated requirements (120,000 ML) highlights the challenge of accurately forecasting water demand. Binding commercial commitments from customers should be secured early to validate demand assumptions.

**Alternative Solutions:**
The Mareeba Dimbulah Efficiency Improvement Project delivered 8,306 ML of water savings for $32.54 million, compared to Nullinga Dam's 55,000-88,000 ML yield for $975 million. This demonstrates the value of evaluating efficiency improvements and demand management before investing in new supply infrastructure.

### Best Practices

**Transparent Business Case Process:**
Building Queensland's public release of both preliminary and detailed business cases, including findings of unviability, represents good practice in transparent infrastructure decision-making. Publishing negative findings allows public understanding of why projects don't proceed.

**Independent Economic Review:**
The peer review of economic analysis by Synergies Economic Consulting added credibility to findings. Independent review of major project business cases is essential for robust decision-making.

**Site Preservation:**
The decision to reserve the Nullinga Dam site for future consideration, despite current unviability, shows prudent long-term planning. Changed circumstances (technology, demand, climate) might alter project economics in the future.

### Challenges Encountered

**Cost Escalation:**
The near-doubling of estimated costs from preliminary ($330 million) to detailed ($975 million) business case raised stakeholder concerns about analysis consistency and methodology. Managing expectations through preliminary estimates while conducting rigorous detailed analysis is a persistent infrastructure planning challenge.

**Stakeholder Expectations:**
MSF Sugar made business plans contingent on the dam proceeding, creating difficult stakeholder management when economic analysis showed unviability. Managing private sector expectations during public infrastructure evaluation is challenging.

**Regional Development Pressures:**
Political and regional development aspirations for Far North Queensland created pressure for new water infrastructure. Balancing regional advocacy with economic evidence requires careful communication and commitment to evidence-based decision-making.

### Legacy

**Evidence-Based Infrastructure Planning:**
Nullinga Dam is a case study in evidence-based infrastructure decision-making. Despite regional development aspirations and stakeholder support, the Queensland Government relied on economic analysis to determine the project should not proceed. This sets a precedent for rigorous project evaluation.

**Catchment Constraints Recognition:**
The project has contributed to understanding of water infrastructure constraints in Far North Queensland, particularly recognition that not all potential dam sites are economically viable despite water demand.

**Efficiency-First Approach:**
The alternative investment in Mareeba Dimbulah scheme efficiency improvements demonstrates a shift toward efficiency and demand management before new supply infrastructure. This approach is increasingly important in water resource management.

**Reserved Site Strategy:**
The practice of reserving the dam site for future consideration while not proceeding currently provides flexibility for changed circumstances while avoiding premature commitment.

### Comparable Projects

**Bradfield Scheme:**
Other large water infrastructure proposals in Far North Queensland (such as periodic revival of Bradfield Scheme concepts) face similar challenges of catchment performance, cost, and economic viability in remote locations.

**Urannah Dam:**
The Urannah Dam proposal in North Queensland has faced similar economic viability questions and benefit-cost ratio challenges, illustrating common issues for water infrastructure in northern Australia.

**Nathan Dam:**
Nathan Dam in Central Queensland was another proposed major water storage that faced economic viability challenges and Native Title issues, ultimately not proceeding despite significant planning investment.

### Future Implications

**Water Infrastructure Planning in Northern Australia:**
Nullinga Dam's discontinuation highlights the challenge of delivering economically viable water infrastructure in northern Australia, where catchment performance is often seasonal and unreliable, distances to markets are large, and costs are high.

**Climate Change Considerations:**
Future reconsideration of the site would need to account for climate change impacts on Walsh River hydrology, potentially further affecting catchment performance and project viability.

**Regional Development Strategy:**
Far North Queensland's regional development strategy must identify economically viable water supply solutions. This may involve:
- Continued focus on efficiency improvements
- Demand management approaches
- Alternative crops with lower water requirements
- Distributed smaller-scale water infrastructure
- Non-water-dependent development pathways

**Business Case Methodology:**
The experience reinforces the importance of:
- Realistic cost estimation
- Conservative demand forecasting
- Thorough hydrological analysis
- Early customer commitment validation
- Comprehensive economic analysis before detailed design investment

The Nullinga Dam case study provides valuable lessons for water infrastructure planning in Australia and demonstrates the importance of rigorous, evidence-based project evaluation even when regional development aspirations are strong.
