## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes Project, also known as the Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline, is a proposed water infrastructure development designed to deliver irrigation water from Paradise Dam to the Coalstoun Lakes and Biggenden area in Queensland's North and South Burnett region. The project was conceived to address the untapped agricultural potential of the Coalstoun Lakes area, which possesses approximately 7,700 hectares of high-quality soils suitable for irrigated agriculture but lacks reliable water supply infrastructure.

The project aims to transform Coalstoun Lakes into one of Queensland's most productive agricultural hubs by providing secure water supply for a diverse range of irrigation crops including sugar cane, peanuts, avocados, vegetables, cotton, and other high-value agricultural commodities. The proposed pipeline would span approximately 35 kilometres, connecting existing infrastructure at Paradise Dam to distribution systems serving the Coalstoun Lakes agricultural area and potentially extending to Biggenden for community water supplies.

Key stakeholders include the Queensland Department of State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning (DSDMIP), which undertook the feasibility assessment; the Australian Government, which provided funding through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund; South Burnett Regional Council and North Burnett Regional Council as local government authorities; and local primary producers and irrigation cooperatives who would be the ultimate beneficiaries of the infrastructure.

The project fits within broader water management planning for the Burnett River catchment and aligns with national priorities for water infrastructure development to support regional economic growth and food security. It was assessed alongside other water infrastructure options as part of the comprehensive North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study completed in 2020.

### Project History and Status

#### Initial Conception and Feasibility Phase (2019-2020)

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline concept emerged from recognition of the significant agricultural potential of the Coalstoun Lakes area, which had been identified through detailed soil surveys as possessing high-quality soils suitable for irrigated agriculture. A comprehensive soil survey conducted in 2000 had mapped approximately 7,700 hectares and identified 15 different soil types, producing detailed crop suitability maps for numerous crops including asparagus, avocado, beans, citrus, grapes, macadamia, mango, peanuts, potatoes, sugar cane, tomatoes, capsicum, cotton, and various grains.

In 2019, the Australian Government committed $2 million to the North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. This study was designed to examine a range of options to increase water supply and security in the North and South Burnett region.

In November 2019, the Australian Government announced an additional $1.5 million in funding specifically to assess the benefits and viability of the Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline project. This supplementary funding was intended to provide "a better understanding of how an expanded Coalstoun Lakes Pipeline could support cane, peanut, avocado and other irrigation crops in the region."

The study commenced in December 2019, with the North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study being completed in April 2020. The total feasibility study funding reached $3.5 million.

#### Detailed Assessment Phase (2020-2022)

Following completion of the broader feasibility study in April 2020, detailed assessment of the Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline continued, building on the completed study. This pipeline-specific assessment was completed in October 2022, producing a detailed business case for the pipeline infrastructure connecting Paradise Dam to Coalstoun Lakes.

During this assessment phase, project costs were initially estimated at approximately $57 million for the pipeline infrastructure. The business case examined the economic viability, technical feasibility, and potential benefits of the proposed infrastructure.

#### Cost Escalation and Project Stagnation (2023-Present)

By October 2023, significant challenges to the project's viability had emerged. Updated cost estimates indicated the project was now priced at approximately $100 million for the 35-kilometre pipeline—nearly double the initial estimates. These cost escalations, reflecting broader infrastructure cost increases across Queensland and Australia during this period, rendered the project economically unviable under existing funding frameworks.

Local media reports in October 2023 indicated that primary producers in Coalstoun Lakes had been "totally left out of further planning" and that the pipeline project from Paradise Dam was "priced well out of contention." This represents a significant setback for a project that had generated considerable optimism among local agricultural producers and regional development advocates.

#### Current Status and Context

As of 2024, the project remains in planning status with no active progression toward approval or construction. The completed feasibility studies and business case provide a foundation for potential future reconsideration if funding circumstances change or alternative delivery models emerge.

The project exists within a complex context of water infrastructure planning in the Burnett region, particularly in relation to the Paradise Dam Improvement Project. Paradise Dam, which would be the water source for the Coalstoun Lakes pipeline, has itself undergone significant challenges and changes. The dam's wall was lowered in 2020 due to structural concerns, reducing its capacity from 300,000 ML to approximately 42% of original capacity. The Paradise Dam Improvement Project, which aims to restore the dam to full capacity, is now estimated to cost at minimum $4.4 billion—a dramatic increase from the original $1.2 billion budget ($600 million federal, $600 million state funding).

These broader challenges with Paradise Dam infrastructure add complexity to the viability timeline for any downstream projects like the Coalstoun Lakes pipeline, as the restoration and improvement of Paradise Dam would likely need to be resolved before major new offtake infrastructure could be justified.

### Financial Details

- **Total Project Cost:** Initial estimates placed project costs at approximately $57 million; subsequent estimates increased to approximately $100 million for a 35-kilometre pipeline from Paradise Dam to Coalstoun Lakes
- **Funding Sources:**
  - Australian Government National Water Infrastructure Development Fund: $3.5 million (feasibility and assessment phase only)
  - No construction funding committed from any source
- **Funding Timeline:**
  - 2019: Initial $2 million feasibility study funding announced
  - November 2019: Additional $1.5 million specifically for Coalstoun Lakes pipeline assessment
  - 2019-2022: Feasibility funding expended
  - 2023-present: No further funding secured or committed
- **Cost Variations:**
  - Initial estimate: ~$57 million
  - Later estimate: ~$100 million for 35km pipeline
  - Represents approximately 75% cost escalation
  - Cost escalation cited as primary barrier to project progression
- **Economic Analysis:** Detailed economic analysis completed as part of feasibility study; specific benefit-cost ratios and NPV calculations not publicly disclosed
- **Operating Costs:** Not publicly disclosed; would be determined during detailed design phase
- **Revenue Streams:** Water delivery charges to irrigators; specific pricing models not developed

The significant cost escalation from approximately $57 million to $100 million represents one of the key challenges facing the project. This escalation reflects broader trends in infrastructure cost increases across Queensland during the 2020-2023 period, driven by factors including construction material cost increases, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 pandemic impacts, and general inflationary pressures.

Without a viable funding pathway at the higher cost estimates, the project has been unable to progress beyond the planning phase despite the identified agricultural potential and regional support.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

No formal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has been prepared for the Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline, as the project has not progressed to the approval phase. If the project were to advance, it would likely require environmental assessment under both Queensland state legislation and potentially Commonwealth legislation depending on matters of national environmental significance.

#### Potential Ecosystem Impacts

The proposed pipeline route would traverse the North and South Burnett landscape, potentially impacting:
- Native vegetation and habitats along the pipeline corridor
- Fauna movement patterns and habitats
- Waterways and riparian zones crossed by the pipeline
- Agricultural landscapes and existing land uses

The Coalstoun Lakes area is located near several areas of environmental significance, including the Coalstoun Lakes National Park and the volcanic landscapes of the Bin Bin Range (Seven Sisters). The area's rich biodiversity would require careful assessment during project planning.

#### Water Quality and Allocation

The project would draw on water allocations from Paradise Dam within the Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme. According to feasibility study findings, there are sufficient water allocations to support growth in the Coalstoun Lakes area and the broader Bundaberg region, suggesting that water availability is not a limiting factor for the project from a resource planning perspective.

However, any expansion of irrigation in the catchment raises broader questions about downstream water users, environmental flows, and cumulative impacts on the Burnett River system and ultimately the Great Barrier Reef catchment.

#### Downstream Effects

The Burnett River flows to the coast near Bundaberg and is part of the Great Barrier Reef catchment. Expanded irrigation in the Coalstoun Lakes area could potentially impact:
- Nutrient and sediment loads in the Burnett River
- Return flows and drainage from irrigated agriculture
- Cumulative water extraction impacts on downstream ecosystems and water users

These impacts would need to be carefully assessed against relevant water quality targets and Great Barrier Reef protection requirements.

#### Mitigation Strategies

While specific mitigation measures have not been developed (as the project has not reached detailed design phase), standard approaches for pipeline infrastructure projects would likely include:
- Route selection to minimize environmental impacts
- Rehabilitation of disturbed areas following construction
- Erosion and sediment control during construction
- Protection of waterway crossings
- Offset strategies for unavoidable vegetation clearing
- Best management practice guidelines for irrigation to minimize off-site water quality impacts

#### Environmental Benefits

Potential environmental benefits claimed for the project include:
- More efficient water use through modern pressurized irrigation systems compared to alternative methods
- Controlled water delivery reducing impacts of unregulated water use
- Potential for water-efficient crop production supporting regional food security

#### Ongoing Monitoring

If the project were to proceed, environmental monitoring requirements would be established through the approval process, likely including water quality monitoring, vegetation rehabilitation monitoring, and compliance with environmental management plans.

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes project area is located within the traditional country of the Wakka Wakka people. The Wakka Wakka are the traditional custodians of the upper and central Burnett River region, including the towns of Gayndah, Mundubbera, and Eidsvold in the north, through to Murgon, Cherbourg, Kingaroy, and Nanango in the south.

On 12 April 2022, following a 25-year legal process that began in 1997, the Wakka Wakka people were granted native title recognition over 114,000 hectares of the Burnett region. This historic recognition came after the project's feasibility study was completed but during the broader assessment phase.

The Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC (Registered Native Title Body Corporate) represents the Wakka Wakka people for native title purposes and would be a key stakeholder in any future progression of the project.

#### Cultural Heritage Significance of the Project Area

The Coalstoun Lakes area holds significant cultural value for the Wakka Wakka people:

**The Seven Sisters (Bin Bin Range):** The seven volcanic mountains that form the Bin Bin Range and run alongside the Coalstoun Lakes area are known as the Seven Sisters and hold cultural significance within Wakka Wakka traditions.

**Ban Ban Springs:** Located nearby, Ban Ban Springs is a traditional site of the Wakka Wakka people and is spiritually significant, being associated with the Rainbow Serpent in Wakka Wakka cultural traditions. Ban Ban Springs is included in the native title area as a significant spiritual and cultural site.

**Cultural Heritage Landscape:** The broader North Burnett region, including Coalstoun Lakes, is recognized as rich in Aboriginal cultural heritage and history, with well-known sites including Ban Ban Springs and Cania Gorge.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment Status

No formal cultural heritage assessment has been conducted for the Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline project, as it has not progressed to the development application or approval phase.

If the project were to advance, it would require:
- Cultural Heritage Management Plan developed in consultation with Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation
- Cultural heritage surveys of the proposed pipeline route
- Assessment of potential impacts on known and previously unidentified cultural heritage sites
- Consultation process with Wakka Wakka traditional owners throughout planning and assessment

#### Consultation Process

No formal consultation process with Wakka Wakka traditional owners has been documented for this specific project. The feasibility study phase primarily focused on technical and economic assessments rather than stakeholder engagement and cultural heritage considerations.

If the project progresses, a comprehensive consultation framework would need to be established in accordance with native title requirements and cultural heritage legislation, including:
- Early engagement with Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation
- Cultural heritage duty of care processes
- Ongoing communication throughout project planning, assessment, and if approved, construction and operation
- Potential for Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) if native title lands are affected

#### Key Concerns

While specific concerns from Wakka Wakka traditional owners regarding this project have not been publicly documented (due to the project's early stage and lack of formal consultation), potential concerns that would typically be considered include:
- Protection of cultural heritage sites along the pipeline route
- Impacts on culturally significant landscapes including the Seven Sisters and connections to Ban Ban Springs
- Protection of water resources and country
- Employment and economic participation opportunities for Wakka Wakka people
- Long-term management and care of country affected by the infrastructure

#### Protection Measures

The Wakka Wakka people play an important role in checking for cultural sites in local development projects in the North Burnett region. Contemporary practice in Queensland requires developers to:
- Engage with traditional owners early in project planning
- Conduct cultural heritage surveys with traditional owner participation
- Develop Cultural Heritage Management Plans
- Implement protection measures for identified sites
- Provide ongoing oversight opportunities for traditional owners

These measures would be required for the Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline if it were to proceed.

#### Ongoing Relationship

If the project were to advance, establishing a positive and ongoing relationship with the Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation and Wakka Wakka traditional owners would be essential. This relationship should be based on:
- Respect for Wakka Wakka cultural heritage and native title rights
- Meaningful consultation and engagement
- Opportunities for Wakka Wakka participation in project delivery and benefits
- Long-term custodianship and management considerations

The recognition of Wakka Wakka native title in 2022 creates a clear framework for this engagement, with the Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation as the formal representative body.

### Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

As the Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline project has not progressed beyond feasibility and planning phase, formal approval processes have not commenced. However, if the project were to advance, it would require a comprehensive suite of approvals.

#### Required Approvals

**Water Resource Approvals:**
- Water entitlements and allocations under the Water Act 2000 (Qld)
- Approval for infrastructure works affecting water resources
- Compliance with relevant water resource plans for the Burnett catchment
- Potentially, amendments to water sharing arrangements

**Environmental Approvals:**
- Development approval under local government planning schemes (South Burnett Regional Council and/or North Burnett Regional Council)
- Environmental authority for environmentally relevant activities if required
- Potential assessment under the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld)
- If matters of national environmental significance are present: referral under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act)
- Assessment under the Planning Act 2016 (Qld) if declared a coordinated project

**Cultural Heritage Approvals:**
- Cultural heritage duty of care process under the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld)
- Cultural Heritage Management Plan agreement with Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation
- Native title considerations and potential Indigenous Land Use Agreement

**Land Access and Tenure:**
- Land acquisition or access agreements for pipeline corridor
- Easements across private and public land
- Tenure arrangements with state-owned land if affected

**Construction and Operational Approvals:**
- Building and construction approvals
- Work health and safety compliance
- Environmental authority for construction activities
- Waterway crossing approvals where pipeline crosses creeks or rivers

#### Approval Status

No approvals have been sought or granted, as the project has not advanced to the approval phase. The feasibility and assessment phase concluded that the project, while technically feasible, faced economic viability challenges due to cost escalation.

#### Regulatory Bodies

Key regulatory agencies that would be involved if the project proceeds include:
- **Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water** (water resource approvals)
- **Department of Environment, Science and Innovation** (environmental approvals)
- **South Burnett Regional Council and North Burnett Regional Council** (planning and development approvals)
- **Department of Resources** (land tenure and access)
- **Office of the Coordinator-General** (if declared a coordinated project)
- **Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water** (if EPBC Act referral required)
- **Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation** (cultural heritage and native title)

#### Approval Timeline

No approval timeline has been established, as the project is not actively progressing. If the project were to advance, a typical approval timeline for water infrastructure of this scale would likely span 2-4 years, including:
- Initial stakeholder consultation: 6-12 months
- Environmental impact assessment: 12-18 months
- Cultural heritage assessment: 6-12 months (potentially concurrent with EIA)
- Approval authority assessment: 6-12 months
- Potential for concurrent approvals processes to reduce overall timeline

#### Conditions

No approval conditions have been established. Conditions would typically address:
- Environmental management and monitoring requirements
- Cultural heritage protection measures
- Water quality monitoring and management
- Construction environmental management
- Ongoing operational compliance and reporting

#### Compliance Requirements

If approved and constructed, the project would face ongoing compliance requirements including:
- Annual reporting to water resource and environmental regulators
- Water quality monitoring and reporting
- Environmental management plan implementation and auditing
- Cultural heritage management plan compliance
- Financial and operational reporting to funding bodies
- Community consultation and stakeholder engagement requirements

The complexity of approvals, particularly in the context of Great Barrier Reef catchment water quality requirements and native title considerations, would add time and cost to project delivery if it were to proceed.

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline would operate within the framework of the Burnett Basin Water Resource Plan and associated resource operations plan. The Burnett catchment has established water allocation frameworks governing surface water and groundwater use.

According to the feasibility study findings, there are sufficient water allocations within existing frameworks to support growth in the Coalstoun Lakes area and the broader Bundaberg region. This suggests that water availability within the planning framework is not a limiting factor for the project, though specific allocation mechanisms and entitlements would need to be determined.

The project would draw on Paradise Dam allocations within the Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme, which is managed by Sunwater. Integration with existing water supply infrastructure and allocation frameworks would be a key aspect of project implementation.

#### Regional Development Context

The North and South Burnett region faces ongoing challenges related to economic diversification, population retention, and agricultural sustainability. The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline was conceived as a regional development catalyst that could:

- **Transform agricultural productivity:** Enable intensive irrigated agriculture on high-quality soils currently underutilized due to water limitations
- **Create employment:** Generate jobs in agriculture, agricultural services, and supporting industries
- **Strengthen regional economy:** Increase agricultural output value and economic resilience
- **Support population retention:** Create economic opportunities encouraging young people to remain in or move to the region
- **Diversify agricultural production:** Enable a wider range of high-value crops beyond traditional dryland farming

The Coalstoun Lakes area, with its 7,700 hectares of identified high-quality irrigable soils, represents one of the significant undeveloped agricultural resources in the North Burnett region. Soil surveys have identified suitability for diverse crops including sugar cane, peanuts, avocados, vegetables, cotton, citrus, macadamias, and other high-value commodities.

#### Water Security Considerations

Water security is a significant issue for the Burnett region, particularly following the reduction in Paradise Dam capacity in 2020. The dam's storage capacity was reduced to approximately 42% of original capacity due to structural concerns, creating uncertainty for existing water users and limiting prospects for expansion.

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline project is therefore linked to the broader question of Paradise Dam's future. The Paradise Dam Improvement Project, which aims to restore the dam to full capacity, is now estimated to cost at minimum $4.4 billion and faces its own viability challenges. Resolution of Paradise Dam's capacity issues would likely be a prerequisite for major new offtake infrastructure investments like the Coalstoun Lakes pipeline.

The project also exists within the context of broader water security planning for Southeast Queensland and regional areas, including consideration of alternative water sources, demand management, and climate adaptation strategies.

#### Stakeholder Support and Opposition

Initial stakeholder support for the Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline was strong among:
- **Local primary producers:** Who saw the project as enabling expansion and diversification of agricultural operations
- **Regional councils:** South Burnett and North Burnett Regional Councils supported the feasibility assessment
- **Agricultural industry groups:** Representative organizations for various agricultural sectors expressed support
- **Regional development advocates:** Saw the project as a catalyst for economic growth

However, by 2023, frustration emerged among local stakeholders over:
- Significant cost escalation rendering the project economically unviable
- Lack of progression from planning to implementation
- Perception that Coalstoun Lakes agricultural potential was being overlooked in regional water infrastructure priorities
- Uncertainty about whether the project would ever proceed

There has been no documented organized opposition to the project, though broader debates about water infrastructure development, environmental protection, and Great Barrier Reef water quality create a complex stakeholder environment for any new irrigation infrastructure in Queensland.

#### Regional Benefits

If implemented, the project would provide specific benefits to the North and South Burnett region including:

**Economic Benefits:**
- Transformation of approximately 7,700 hectares of underutilized agricultural land into productive irrigated agriculture
- Increased agricultural output value (specific estimates not publicly disclosed)
- Job creation in farming, agricultural services, processing, and transport
- Multiplier effects through increased economic activity in regional towns

**Social Benefits:**
- Enhanced water security for Coalstoun Lakes and potentially Biggenden communities
- Strengthened rural communities through economic growth
- Improved prospects for intergenerational farming succession
- Enhanced service viability in regional centers

**Infrastructure Benefits:**
- Utilization of existing Paradise Dam infrastructure
- Improved water distribution efficiency
- Modern irrigation infrastructure supporting best management practices

#### Integration with Other Projects

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline exists within a broader portfolio of water infrastructure planning in the Burnett region:

**Paradise Dam Improvement Project:** The proposal to restore Paradise Dam to full capacity is the most significant related project. Originally budgeted at $1.2 billion, now estimated at minimum $4.4 billion, this project would be foundational to the viability of expanded irrigation infrastructure like the Coalstoun Lakes pipeline.

**Bundaberg and Burnett Regional Water Assessment:** Ongoing Queensland Government assessment examining water infrastructure options across the broader region.

**Other Burnett Feasibility Projects:** The North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study examined multiple options including:
- Barlil Weir (which received approval for further assessment)
- Other water storage and distribution options
- Demand management and efficiency measures

The Coalstoun Lakes pipeline was one component of this broader regional water planning exercise, and its future may depend on how the overall regional water strategy evolves and which projects receive priority for funding and implementation.

#### Comparable Regional Water Infrastructure

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline can be compared to other regional irrigation pipeline projects in Queensland including:
- Burdekin-Haughton Water Supply Scheme extensions
- Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme infrastructure
- Dawson Valley Water Supply Scheme components

These comparisons highlight common challenges including cost escalation, approval complexity, and balancing agricultural development with environmental protection in Great Barrier Reef catchments.

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline project, despite not proceeding to construction, offers several important lessons for water infrastructure planning in Queensland:

**1. Cost Escalation Risk:** The near-doubling of cost estimates from $57 million to $100 million highlights the significant risk of infrastructure cost escalation, particularly during periods of economic volatility. This underscores the importance of:
- Conservative cost estimation with adequate contingencies
- Regular cost estimate updates during extended planning periods
- Early commitment of funding to lock in costs
- Value engineering and alternative delivery models to manage costs

**2. Importance of Comprehensive Feasibility Assessment:** The thorough feasibility study process, while unable to identify a viable pathway forward under current cost estimates, provided valuable information about the agricultural potential of the Coalstoun Lakes area and the technical feasibility of the pipeline. This information remains available for future reconsideration if circumstances change.

**3. Integration with Broader Infrastructure Planning:** The project's viability is inherently linked to the broader Paradise Dam situation, highlighting the importance of integrated infrastructure planning rather than assessment of individual projects in isolation.

**4. Gap Between Agricultural Potential and Infrastructure Viability:** The disconnect between identified agricultural potential (7,700 hectares of high-quality irrigable soils) and infrastructure viability (pipeline costs exceeding economic returns) illustrates the challenges of unlocking regional agricultural resources in an era of high infrastructure costs.

**5. Early Engagement with Traditional Owners:** The recognition of Wakka Wakka native title during the project's planning phase highlights the importance of early and meaningful engagement with First Nations peoples in project planning, rather than treating cultural heritage as a late-stage compliance issue.

#### Best Practices Demonstrated

**Comprehensive Soil Resource Assessment:** The detailed soil surveys of the Coalstoun Lakes area, completed in 2000 and informing the pipeline feasibility assessment, represent best practice in agricultural resource assessment. The crop suitability mapping for numerous commodities provides a robust foundation for land use planning.

**Transparent Feasibility Assessment:** The project underwent rigorous feasibility assessment funded through appropriate mechanisms (National Water Infrastructure Development Fund), producing business case analysis that informed decision-making.

**Recognition of Economic Viability Challenges:** Rather than proceeding with an economically marginal project, decision-makers have appropriately recognized the viability challenges and not committed construction funding, avoiding potential cost overruns and failed infrastructure investments.

#### Challenges Encountered

**Infrastructure Cost Inflation:** The project encountered the fundamental challenge of infrastructure cost escalation outpacing agricultural productivity gains and water value, rendering a technically feasible project economically unviable.

**Paradise Dam Uncertainty:** The broader uncertainty about Paradise Dam's capacity and future created additional complexity for downstream infrastructure planning.

**Funding Model Limitations:** Traditional public funding models for irrigation infrastructure face challenges when capital costs are high relative to user base and ability to pay. Alternative funding and delivery models (such as greater private sector involvement or different cost-sharing arrangements) were apparently not sufficient to overcome viability challenges.

**Extended Planning Timeframes:** The extended period from initial feasibility study (2019) through detailed assessment (2022) to recognition of project stagnation (2023) represents a multi-year process that creates uncertainty for potential beneficiaries and may contribute to cost escalation.

#### Legacy and Ongoing Relevance

Despite not proceeding to construction, the Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline project leaves several legacies:

**Information Base:** The comprehensive feasibility studies, business case, and assessment reports provide a detailed information base that could inform future reconsideration if circumstances change (such as reduced construction costs, increased agricultural commodity prices, or alternative funding models).

**Agricultural Resource Knowledge:** The project has reinforced awareness of the significant agricultural potential of the Coalstoun Lakes area, which may influence future regional planning and land use decisions.

**Regional Development Conversation:** The project has been part of ongoing regional conversations about water security, agricultural development, and economic opportunities in the North and South Burnett region.

**Infrastructure Planning Methodology:** The comprehensive assessment process may inform methodology for future water infrastructure feasibility studies in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia.

#### Future Implications

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline project raises important questions for future water infrastructure planning in Queensland:

**1. Viability of New Irrigation Infrastructure:** If a project with clear agricultural potential, good soil resources, and identified water availability cannot proceed due to pipeline costs, what does this mean for other potential irrigation expansion projects across regional Queensland?

**2. Alternative Delivery Models:** Does the traditional public funding and delivery model for irrigation infrastructure remain viable in a high-cost environment? What alternative models (public-private partnerships, irrigator-led cooperatives, innovative financing) might enable projects that appear unviable under traditional assessment?

**3. Role of Scale:** Would smaller-scale, staged developments be more viable than large single-stage infrastructure investments? Could modular approaches reduce upfront capital requirements and risk?

**4. Integration with Renewable Energy:** Could integration with renewable energy development (solar-powered pumping, co-location of infrastructure) improve project economics?

**5. Climate Adaptation Context:** As climate change increases pressure on water resources and agricultural systems, how should the trade-offs between new irrigation development and environmental water protection be considered in water resource planning?

#### Comparable Projects

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline can be instructively compared to other Queensland water infrastructure projects:

**Projects That Proceeded Despite Challenges:**
- Paradise Dam itself (original construction, now facing major remediation costs)
- Burdekin Falls Dam and associated irrigation infrastructure
- Projects that demonstrate both the potential benefits and long-term challenges of major water infrastructure

**Projects That Stalled:**
- Various components of the Bradfield Scheme and other large-scale water transfer concepts
- Other proposals assessed through feasibility studies but not progressing to construction

**Recent Irrigation Developments:**
- More modest-scale irrigation developments
- Off-stream storage projects
- Private sector-led irrigation schemes

These comparisons suggest that contemporary water infrastructure development in Queensland faces significant economic, environmental, and approval challenges, with only projects demonstrating clear economic viability, strong political support, or unique strategic value able to proceed to implementation.

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes pipeline remains a valuable case study in comprehensive infrastructure assessment, honest recognition of economic viability challenges, and the complex factors that determine whether identified opportunities can be translated into constructed infrastructure.
