## Project Overview

The Paradise to Coalstoun Lakes Project is a proposed 35-kilometre irrigation pipeline designed to deliver water from Paradise Dam to the Coalstoun Lakes and Biggenden area in Queensland's North and South Burnett region. The project aims to unlock approximately 7,700 hectares of high-quality agricultural soils that have been identified through detailed soil surveys but remain underutilised due to lack of reliable water supply.

A comprehensive soil survey conducted in 2000 mapped the Coalstoun Lakes area and identified 15 different soil types with suitability for diverse crops including sugar cane, peanuts, avocados, vegetables, cotton, citrus, macadamias, and various grains. This agricultural potential drove interest in connecting the area to Paradise Dam water supplies.

The project received $3.5 million in feasibility funding through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, comprising $2 million for the broader North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study and an additional $1.5 million specifically for the Coalstoun Lakes pipeline assessment.

## Project History

In November 2019, the Australian Government announced $1.5 million in additional funding to assess the Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline, building on the broader North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study that commenced in December 2019. The federal announcement stated the funding would provide "a better understanding of how an expanded Coalstoun Lakes Pipeline could support cane, peanut, avocado and other irrigation crops in the region."

The North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study was completed in April 2020. The detailed pipeline-specific assessment continued through to October 2022, when the Assessment of the Feasibility of the Coalstoun Lakes Irrigation Pipeline was completed.

Initial cost estimates placed the project at approximately $57 million. However, by 2023 the project had stalled due to significant cost escalation, with estimates reportedly reaching approximately $100 million for the 35-kilometre pipeline. This cost increase, reflecting broader infrastructure cost pressures during 2020-2023, rendered the project economically challenging under existing funding frameworks.

According to the feasibility study findings, there are sufficient water allocations within the Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme to support growth in the Coalstoun Lakes area and the broader Bundaberg region.

## Environmental Considerations

No formal Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared as the project has not progressed to the approval phase. The proposed pipeline route would traverse agricultural and native landscapes in the North and South Burnett region, potentially affecting native vegetation, fauna habitats, and waterway crossings.

The Burnett River is part of the Great Barrier Reef catchment, meaning any expanded irrigation would need to address water quality considerations and comply with reef protection requirements. Specific environmental impacts and mitigation measures would be determined during detailed design and environmental assessment if the project were to proceed.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area lies within the traditional country of the Wakka Wakka people, who are the traditional custodians of the upper and central Burnett River region. On 12 April 2022, the Wakka Wakka people received native title recognition over 114,000 hectares of the Burnett region following a 25-year legal process that began in 1997.

No formal cultural heritage assessment or consultation with Wakka Wakka traditional owners has been documented for this project, as it has not advanced to the development application phase. If the project were to proceed, a Cultural Heritage Management Plan developed in consultation with the Wakka Wakka Native Title Aboriginal Corporation would be required.

## Regional Context

The project exists within a complex water infrastructure planning environment in the Burnett region. Paradise Dam, which would be the water source for the pipeline, had its wall lowered in 2020 due to structural concerns, reducing capacity to approximately 42% of original storage. The Paradise Dam Improvement Project to restore full capacity is now estimated to cost at minimum $4.4 billion.

The North and South Burnett Regions Feasibility Study examined multiple water infrastructure options across the region. The Coalstoun Lakes pipeline was one component of this broader assessment, alongside options including Barlil Weir and other water storage and distribution improvements.
