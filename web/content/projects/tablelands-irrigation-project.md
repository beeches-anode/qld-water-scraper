## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Tablelands Irrigation Project, also known as the Southern Atherton Tablelands Irrigation Development, was a proposed multipurpose water infrastructure scheme in Far North Queensland. The project was conceived to address water security challenges in the Atherton Tablelands and Herbert River regions while supporting agricultural expansion and regional economic development.

Undertaken by the Tablelands Regional Council with $750,000 in federal government funding from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (later National Water Grid Authority), the project developed a preliminary business case examining the viability of multipurpose water use options as a vehicle to drive regional economic growth and achieve industry development and community benefit.

The project's scope included investigating the construction of three dam storages on the upper and middle reaches of the Herbert River and the Millstream, with the flagship proposal being a 35,000 ML dam on the Herbert River in the Woodleigh area near Ravenshoe (commonly referred to as the Woodleigh Dam). The scheme also examined the feasibility of developing a network of irrigation channels to supply water to good quality agricultural land around Atherton and the Barron River catchment.

The project was promoted as a multipurpose scheme that could deliver irrigation supply, hydroelectric power generation, and flood mitigation for the lower Herbert River area around Ingham. Proponents, including local Member of Parliament Nick Dametto, advocated for the project as providing long-term water security for the wider region and enabling crop diversification extending from the Herbert River District north to the Atherton Tablelands.

The ambitious vision suggested the Southern Atherton Tablelands Development Scheme could create 100,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture, significantly expand the region's agricultural productivity, reduce flood damage in the Ingham area, and generate hydroelectric power to contribute to the region's renewable energy profile.

However, the project did not advance beyond the preliminary business case stage. The subsequent Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023), which examined 113 potential water supply initiatives across the region, prioritized alternative options including efficiency improvements to the existing Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme rather than new large-scale dam construction.

### Key Specifications

- **Capacity/Scale:**
  - Proposed Woodleigh Dam: 35,000 ML storage capacity on Herbert River near Ravenshoe
  - Additional dam storages proposed on upper and middle reaches of Herbert River and Millstream (capacities not specified in available documents)
  - Potential irrigation area: up to 100,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture
  - Service area: Western Tablelands Regional Council areas around Mt Garnet and Innot Hot Springs, land around Atherton and Barron River catchment, Herbert River District

- **Infrastructure Components:**
  - Three multipurpose dam storages on Herbert River and Millstream
  - Network of irrigation channels to distribute water to agricultural land
  - Hydroelectric power generation facilities integrated with dam infrastructure
  - Water distribution infrastructure to serve diverse agricultural areas

- **Design Features:**
  - Multipurpose design integrating irrigation supply, flood mitigation, and hydroelectric power generation
  - Located in upper catchment areas to maximize storage potential and gravity-fed distribution
  - Intended to complement existing Tinaroo Dam and Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation scheme

- **Operational Parameters:**
  - Would operate as part of broader Herbert River and Barron River catchment water management
  - Designed to provide reliable water supply for diverse cropping including high-value horticulture
  - Flood mitigation operations to reduce wet season flooding in lower Herbert around Ingham
  - Integration with regional water allocation frameworks

### Project History and Status

#### Conception and Feasibility Funding (2016-2017)

The concept of large-scale water infrastructure development in the Atherton Tablelands has historical precedents, with the successful Tinaroo Dam constructed in 1955 to support the Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation scheme. The Tablelands Irrigation Project represented a new iteration of this vision, seeking to expand irrigation capacity through additional storage on the Herbert River system.

The Australian Government announced $750,000 in funding for the Tablelands Irrigation Project Feasibility Study through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF). This funding was part of a broader federal investment in assessing water infrastructure opportunities across Australia. The feasibility study was undertaken by the Tablelands Regional Council to develop a preliminary business case examining multipurpose water use options to drive regional economic growth.

#### Preliminary Business Case Development (2017-2019)

The Tablelands Regional Council conducted the feasibility study, examining the viability of the Southern Atherton Tablelands irrigation development scheme. The study scope included:

- Investigating the feasibility of developing a network of irrigation channels to supply water to agricultural land around Atherton and the Barron River catchment
- Assessing the feasibility of three dam storages on the upper and middle reaches of the Herbert River and Millstream
- Evaluating whether these multipurpose dams could provide irrigation supply, hydroelectric power, and flood mitigation in the lower Herbert River reaches
- Determining whether 100,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture could be created in the region
- Analyzing potential for flood mitigation around Ingham and hydroelectric power generation

The preliminary business case was completed by 2019, though the detailed findings were not released publicly. The business case is referenced on the Tablelands Regional Council website with a link to download the document, though specific cost-benefit analysis results, NPV calculations, and detailed recommendations remain unavailable in the public domain.

#### Political Advocacy (2019)

In March 2019, Nick Dametto MP, the Member for Hinchinbrook representing the Katter's Australian Party, publicly promoted the vision for damming the Herbert River to provide long-term water security for the wider region. Dametto specifically highlighted the proposal for a 35,000 ML dam on the Herbert River in the Woodleigh area near Ravenshoe.

Dametto's advocacy emphasized that the project would provide water supply for crop diversity in the Herbert River District, with benefits extending north to the Atherton Tablelands. He noted that a reliable water supply would enable crop diversification and potentially serve as a source of hydroelectric power. Dametto stated he was prepared to "consider all options" for construction of a potential dam and would engage with stakeholders, while acknowledging this was not the first time such a proposal had been considered.

#### Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023)

Rather than proceeding directly to a detailed business case for the Tablelands Irrigation Project, the Queensland Government initiated a comprehensive Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (RWA) beginning in late 2021. This broader assessment process involved:

- Identifying and considering 113 potential water supply and security initiatives in the Tablelands region
- Technical analysis and extensive stakeholder consultation
- Assessing the seven most viable options in detail
- Evaluating both supply-side options (new infrastructure) and demand-side options (efficiency improvements)

The draft Tablelands Regional Water Assessment was released for public consultation in mid-2023. Significantly, the assessment did not prioritize the dam construction options that were central to the original Tablelands Irrigation Project. Instead, the RWA recommended:

1. **Priority Option:** Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project Stage 2 – recommended to proceed to detailed business case
2. **Long-term Option:** North Johnstone Diversion (Johnstone River to Tinaroo Falls Dam Pipeline) – identified for further investigation but categorized as long-term priority (10+ years)
3. **Water Allocation:** Release of unallocated water from reserves identified in the new Barron Water Plan

The final Tablelands Regional Water Assessment was completed in 2023 and is available on the Queensland Government's Department of Local Government, Water and Volunteers website.

#### Current Status

The Tablelands Irrigation Project, including the Woodleigh Dam proposal, has not proceeded beyond the preliminary business case stage. The project is effectively discontinued, with regional water security priorities shifting toward efficiency improvements to existing infrastructure (Mareeba-Dimbulah scheme) rather than construction of new large-scale dams.

No detailed business case has been commissioned, no environmental impact assessment has been undertaken, and no regulatory approvals have been sought. The project exists as a completed feasibility study that informed broader regional water planning but was not itself advanced to implementation.

### Financial Details

- **Total Project Cost:** Not publicly disclosed; preliminary business case did not release detailed cost estimates

- **Feasibility Study Funding:** $750,000 from Australian Government (National Water Infrastructure Development Fund / National Water Grid Authority)

- **Funding Timeline:** Feasibility study funding announced 2016-2017; funding utilized 2017-2019 for preliminary business case development

- **Economic Analysis:** Preliminary business case examined viability of multipurpose water use options for regional economic growth, but specific economic modeling results (NPV, BCR, economic impact projections) were not released publicly

- **Comparison to Similar Projects:** The related Nullinga Dam proposal in the Atherton Tablelands region underwent detailed business case analysis by Building Queensland, which found the project was not economically viable. Water costs were projected at upward of $15,900 per megalitre, while potential customers indicated willingness to pay only $2,000-$3,000 per megalitre. This economic analysis may provide context for why the Tablelands Irrigation Project did not proceed to detailed business case.

- **Alternative Investment:** The Queensland Government and Sunwater instead invested $28 million in the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project to modernize the existing irrigation scheme. This project, completed in recent years, exceeded expectations by saving 11,500 megalitres annually (far exceeding the target of 8,306 megalitres) and is expected to deliver more than $20 million per year in increased agricultural production for the Tablelands.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Context

The Herbert River catchment operates within the Wet Tropics region, which includes World Heritage-listed rainforest areas and catchments that discharge to the Great Barrier Reef. The Herbert River has significant environmental challenges:

- **Water Quality Issues:** The Herbert River contributes the largest anthropogenic loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the Wet Tropics region, with most coming from sugarcane production
- **Sediment Loads:** The Herbert River contributes the largest fine sediment loads in the Wet Tropics region, primarily from streambank erosion
- **Great Barrier Reef Connection:** Water quality in the Herbert River directly affects the Great Barrier Reef, with sediment and nutrient loads impacting reef ecosystems

#### Potential Environmental Impacts

While the project did not advance to Environmental Impact Assessment, potential environmental considerations would have included:

- **Flow Regime Alteration:** Dam construction on the Herbert River would significantly alter natural flow patterns, affecting downstream ecosystems that depend on seasonal flow variability
- **Water Quality Impacts:** Changes to sediment transport, nutrient cycling, and water temperature downstream of dam infrastructure
- **Aquatic Ecosystem Impacts:** Effects on fish passage, aquatic habitat, and biodiversity in the Herbert River and Millstream
- **Floodplain Ecology:** Alteration of natural flooding cycles affecting floodplain wetlands and riparian ecosystems
- **Wet Tropics World Heritage Area:** Potential impacts on World Heritage values given the project's location in the Wet Tropics region
- **Great Barrier Reef Water Quality:** Altered sediment and nutrient delivery to coastal waters and reef ecosystems
- **Terrestrial Impacts:** Inundation of terrestrial habitat for dam reservoir, construction impacts on rainforest and other native vegetation
- **Cumulative Impacts:** Interaction with existing water infrastructure (Tinaroo Dam, Mareeba-Dimbulah scheme) and other land uses

#### Claimed Environmental Benefits

Proponents suggested potential environmental benefits including:

- **Flood Mitigation:** Reduction of flood damage in the lower Herbert River area around Ingham by storing wet season flows
- **Sediment Management:** Potential to trap sediment in storage, reducing downstream sediment loads
- **Clean Energy:** Hydroelectric power generation contributing to renewable energy and "clean and green" regional image

#### Regulatory Requirements

Had the project proceeded, it would have required:

- **State Environmental Impact Statement:** Under Queensland's Environmental Protection Act for major water infrastructure
- **Commonwealth EPBC Act Assessment:** Likely referral to federal government due to potential impacts on Great Barrier Reef (World Heritage, National Heritage, and listed marine environment) and Wet Tropics World Heritage Area
- **Water Resource Planning:** Amendments to relevant water plans, water allocation approvals under Queensland Water Act
- **Cultural Heritage Assessment:** Under Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act and Native Title Act
- **Other Approvals:** Planning approvals, vegetation management approvals, fisheries approvals

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The Atherton Tablelands and Herbert River catchment area are traditional lands of several First Nations groups:

- **Jirrbal (Wabubadda) People:** Hold Native Title rights over traditional land and waters around Ravenshoe and Herberton area, directly encompassing the proposed Woodleigh Dam location near Ravenshoe
- **Bar-Barrum People:** Hold Native Title rights over land and waters on the Atherton Tableland including the Walsh River area
- **Ngadjon-ji (Choorechillum) People:** Hold Native Title rights over parts of Wooroonooran National Park and other areas in the region; registered Cultural Heritage Body for some areas
- **Djirrbal People:** Traditional connections to eastern rainforest areas of the Tablelands

Indigenous Australians have occupied the Atherton Tablelands for tens of thousands of years, with deep cultural, spiritual, and economic connections to waterways, land, and natural resources in the region.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

The project did not advance to the stage of conducting formal cultural heritage assessment. Had it proceeded, the following would have been required:

- **Cultural Heritage Management Plan:** Under Queensland's Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act, developed in consultation with Traditional Owner groups
- **Native Title Consultation:** Formal engagement with Native Title holders and claimants
- **Heritage Surveys:** Field surveys to identify cultural heritage sites, places of significance, and cultural values
- **Traditional Owner Agreement:** Potential Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) or cultural heritage agreement

#### Consultation Process

No formal consultation process with Traditional Owner groups was undertaken, as the project remained at preliminary business case stage. The Tablelands Regional Council has stated a general commitment to working with traditional owners and relevant government agencies to ensure cultural heritage issues are managed in accordance with legislative requirements.

#### Cultural Heritage Considerations

Potential cultural heritage issues that would have required assessment included:

- **Waterway Significance:** Cultural and spiritual significance of the Herbert River and Millstream to Traditional Owners
- **Sites and Places:** Archaeological sites, ceremonial places, story places, and other culturally significant locations that might be affected by inundation or construction
- **Resource Use:** Traditional use of water, fish, plants, and other resources in the project area
- **Connection to Country:** Impacts on Traditional Owners' ability to maintain connection to Country through access, cultural practices, and knowledge transmission
- **Cultural Landscapes:** Effects on broader cultural landscape values and integrity

### Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

#### Required Approvals

Had the project proceeded beyond preliminary business case, the following approvals would have been required:

- **State Approvals:**
  - Environmental Impact Statement under Environmental Protection Act
  - Water infrastructure approval under Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act
  - Water resource plan amendments and water allocations under Water Act 2000
  - Development approvals under Planning Act
  - Vegetation management approvals if clearing required
  - Fisheries approvals under Fisheries Act
  - Cultural heritage approvals under Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act

- **Commonwealth Approvals:**
  - Assessment under Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, likely triggered by:
    - Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (World Heritage property)
    - Wet Tropics of Queensland (World Heritage property)
    - Great Barrier Reef (National Heritage place)
    - Listed threatened species and communities
    - Listed migratory species
  - Native Title consultation and potential agreements under Native Title Act 1993

- **Other Approvals:**
  - Construction permits and safety certifications for dam infrastructure
  - Electricity generation and connection approvals for hydroelectric components
  - Land acquisition or access agreements

#### Approval Status

No approvals were sought; the project did not proceed beyond preliminary business case to detailed design or environmental assessment stages.

#### Regulatory Context

The complex regulatory environment for new water infrastructure in Queensland, particularly in environmentally sensitive areas like the Wet Tropics and Great Barrier Reef catchments, represents a significant barrier to large-scale dam development. The rigorous environmental assessment requirements, potential for federal intervention on environmental grounds, and extensive consultation requirements contribute to long approval timelines and uncertainty.

This regulatory complexity, combined with economic viability questions (as evidenced by the Nullinga Dam business case findings), likely contributed to the decision not to advance the Tablelands Irrigation Project to detailed business case and approvals stages.

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The Tablelands region's water resources are managed under Queensland's water planning framework:

- **Barron Water Plan:** Manages water resources in the Barron River catchment, including Tinaroo Dam and Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme
- **Herbert Water Plan:** Manages water resources in the Herbert River catchment
- **Wet Tropics Water Plans:** Broader regional water planning considering environmental values, agricultural water security, and Great Barrier Reef water quality targets

The Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023) identified potential to release unallocated water from reserves in the Barron Water Plan, providing an alternative approach to increasing water availability without major new infrastructure construction.

#### Regional Development

The Atherton Tablelands region is one of Queensland's significant food production areas:

- **Agricultural Diversity:** More than 17,000 hectares of farmland producing bananas, mangoes, avocados, coffee, tea trees, vegetables, dairy, and other products
- **Mareeba-Dimbulah Scheme:** Existing irrigation infrastructure serving the region, with water availability a key driver for economic growth and jobs
- **Economic Importance:** Agricultural production supports regional employment, export earnings, and community sustainability

The Tablelands Irrigation Project was conceived as supporting regional agricultural expansion, diversification, and water security. However, the Tablelands Regional Water Assessment ultimately prioritized efficiency improvements to existing infrastructure (Mareeba-Dimbulah scheme) as the most viable pathway to enhanced water security and regional development.

#### Water Security

Water security challenges in the Tablelands region include:

- **Climate Variability:** Seasonal and inter-annual variability in rainfall affecting water availability
- **Agricultural Demand:** Growing demand for irrigation water to support high-value horticulture and intensive agriculture
- **Competing Uses:** Balancing agricultural, urban, environmental, and cultural water needs
- **Infrastructure Efficiency:** Aging infrastructure in existing schemes requiring modernization

The $28 million Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project addressed water security through demand management and efficiency, saving 11,500 megalitres annually and delivering more than $20 million per year in increased agricultural production. This efficiency-first approach contrasts with the supply-side focus of the Tablelands Irrigation Project's proposed dam construction.

#### Stakeholder Support

Stakeholder perspectives on the Tablelands Irrigation Project varied:

- **Proponents:** Local MP Nick Dametto, some agricultural stakeholders, and regional development advocates supported the vision of enhanced water security and agricultural expansion
- **Regional Assessment Process:** The Tablelands Regional Water Assessment involved extensive stakeholder consultation, identifying 113 potential initiatives and assessing stakeholder priorities
- **Alternative Priorities:** Through the RWA process, stakeholders and technical assessment prioritized efficiency improvements and other options over large-scale dam construction

#### Integration with Other Projects

The Tablelands Irrigation Project exists within a broader landscape of regional water initiatives:

- **Mareeba-Dimbulah Efficiency Improvements:** Prioritized alternative delivering significant water savings and agricultural benefits
- **Nullinga Dam Proposal:** Related proposal that underwent detailed business case analysis but was found economically unviable
- **North Johnstone Diversion:** Long-term option identified in Tablelands RWA for pipeline from Johnstone River to Tinaroo Falls Dam
- **Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Programs:** Regional efforts to improve catchment water quality affecting project viability and environmental constraints

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

The Tablelands Irrigation Project offers several lessons for water infrastructure planning in Queensland and Australia:

1. **Feasibility vs. Viability:** Federal feasibility study funding enabled preliminary assessment, but economic viability analysis (as demonstrated by the related Nullinga Dam business case) can reveal significant challenges with large-scale dam construction in modern economic and environmental contexts

2. **Efficiency Before Supply:** The success of the Mareeba-Dimbulah efficiency improvements demonstrates that demand management and infrastructure modernization can deliver significant water security and economic benefits at lower cost and environmental impact than new supply infrastructure

3. **Comprehensive Regional Assessment:** The Tablelands Regional Water Assessment's approach of examining 113 potential initiatives and assessing multiple options provided a more robust planning framework than pursuing individual projects in isolation

4. **Environmental Constraints:** Projects in environmentally sensitive areas (Wet Tropics, Great Barrier Reef catchments) face significant regulatory requirements and environmental considerations that affect viability

5. **Economic Viability Challenges:** Modern water infrastructure must demonstrate strong economic returns; the gap between projected water costs ($15,900/ML for Nullinga Dam) and customer willingness to pay ($2,000-$3,000/ML) illustrates fundamental economic challenges

#### Best Practices

Elements of good practice in this project's development included:

- Federal funding for preliminary feasibility assessment before major commitments
- Development of preliminary business case to examine viability
- Integration into broader regional water assessment rather than proceeding in isolation
- Consideration of multipurpose benefits (irrigation, flood mitigation, hydroelectric power)

#### Challenges

Challenges encountered included:

- Economic viability questions that prevented progression to detailed business case
- Complex environmental regulatory environment in Wet Tropics and Great Barrier Reef catchments
- Competition from alternative approaches (efficiency improvements) offering better value proposition
- Limited public transparency regarding preliminary business case findings

#### Legacy

The Tablelands Irrigation Project's legacy includes:

- **Feasibility Study Contribution:** The preliminary business case contributed to regional water planning knowledge and informed the subsequent Tablelands Regional Water Assessment
- **Policy Direction:** The project's experience, combined with the Nullinga Dam findings, contributed to a shift in regional water security strategy toward efficiency and demand management rather than large-scale new supply infrastructure
- **Regional Planning Model:** The transition from individual project assessment to comprehensive regional water assessment (Tablelands RWA) represents an evolution in water planning methodology

#### Comparable Projects

The Tablelands Irrigation Project can be compared to:

- **Nullinga Dam (Atherton Tablelands):** Related proposal in same region that reached detailed business case stage but was found economically unviable; water costs of $15,900/ML far exceeded customer capacity to pay
- **Bradfield Scheme:** Historical large-scale water diversion proposal for North Queensland that has been repeatedly assessed but not implemented due to economic and environmental concerns
- **Mareeba-Dimbulah Efficiency Project:** Alternative approach that delivered significant water security improvements through infrastructure modernization rather than new construction; exceeded targets with 11,500 ML annual savings and $20 million+ in annual agricultural production benefits
- **Hells Gates Dam (Burdekin):** Proposed large dam in North Queensland that has undergone multiple assessments over decades but not proceeded due to economic viability questions

#### Future Implications

The Tablelands Irrigation Project experience has implications for future water infrastructure planning:

- **Efficiency First:** Prioritizing efficiency improvements and demand management before new supply infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Regional Assessment:** Assessing multiple options through regional water assessments rather than pursuing individual projects in isolation
- **Economic Rigor:** Requiring strong economic analysis early in project development, including realistic assessment of customer capacity to pay
- **Environmental Integration:** Early consideration of environmental constraints and regulatory requirements in environmentally sensitive regions
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Broad stakeholder consultation to identify priorities and build support for viable approaches
- **Incremental vs. Large-Scale:** Considering whether incremental improvements to existing systems may offer better value than large new infrastructure

The project demonstrates that while water security remains a critical challenge for regional Queensland, the pathway to enhanced security increasingly involves optimization of existing systems, efficiency improvements, and careful economic and environmental analysis of new supply options.
