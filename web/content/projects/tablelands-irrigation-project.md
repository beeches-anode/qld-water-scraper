## Project Overview

The Tablelands Irrigation Project, also known as the Southern Atherton Tablelands Irrigation Development, was a proposed multipurpose water infrastructure scheme in Far North Queensland. Undertaken by the Tablelands Regional Council with $750,000 in federal funding from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, the project developed a preliminary business case examining multipurpose water use options to drive regional economic growth.

The project scope included investigating construction of three dam storages on the upper and middle reaches of the Herbert River and the Millstream, with the flagship proposal being a 35,000 ML dam in the Woodleigh area near Ravenshoe. The scheme also examined the feasibility of developing a network of irrigation channels to supply water to agricultural land around Atherton and the Barron River catchment.

The project did not advance beyond the preliminary business case stage. The subsequent Tablelands Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023), which examined 113 potential water supply initiatives across the region, prioritized alternative options including efficiency improvements to the existing Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme rather than new large-scale dam construction.

## Project History

The Australian Government announced feasibility funding in 2016-2017 through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. The Tablelands Regional Council conducted the feasibility study examining the viability of multipurpose dams that could provide irrigation supply, hydroelectric power, and flood mitigation in the lower Herbert River reaches around Ingham.

In March 2019, Nick Dametto MP (Member for Hinchinbrook, Katter's Australian Party) publicly promoted the vision for damming the Herbert River, specifically highlighting the proposed 35,000 ML Woodleigh Dam. Dametto emphasised that reliable water supply would enable crop diversification in the Herbert River District extending north to the Atherton Tablelands.

Rather than proceeding to a detailed business case, the Queensland Government initiated a comprehensive Tablelands Regional Water Assessment beginning in late 2021. This assessment examined 113 potential water supply initiatives and assessed the seven most viable options in detail. The final assessment, completed in 2023, recommended the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project Stage 2 proceed to detailed business case, while identifying the North Johnstone Diversion as a long-term option (10+ years). Dam construction options central to the original Tablelands Irrigation Project were not prioritized.

## Environmental Considerations

The Herbert River catchment operates within the Wet Tropics region, which includes World Heritage-listed rainforest areas and catchments discharging to the Great Barrier Reef. According to Reef Plan catchment targets, the Herbert River contributes the largest anthropogenic loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the Wet Tropics region (primarily from sugarcane production) and the largest fine sediment loads (primarily from streambank erosion).

The project did not advance to Environmental Impact Assessment. Had it proceeded, it would have required comprehensive assessment under Queensland's Environmental Protection Act and likely referral under the Commonwealth EPBC Act due to potential impacts on the Great Barrier Reef and Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.

## Cultural Heritage

The project area encompasses lands of several Traditional Owner groups. The Jirrbal (Wabubadda) people hold Native Title rights over traditional land and waters around Ravenshoe and Herberton, directly encompassing the proposed Woodleigh Dam location. The Bar-Barrum People hold Native Title rights over land and waters on the Atherton Tableland including the Walsh River area. The Ngadjon-ji (Choorechillum) people hold Native Title rights over parts of the region and are a registered Cultural Heritage Body for some areas.

No formal cultural heritage assessment was conducted as the project remained at preliminary feasibility stage. Had it advanced, a Cultural Heritage Management Plan and formal consultation with Traditional Owner groups would have been required.

## Regional Context

The Tablelands Irrigation Project exists within a broader landscape of regional water initiatives. The related Nullinga Dam proposal in the same region underwent detailed business case analysis by Building Queensland but was found economically unviable, with projected water costs of $15,900 per megalitre against customer willingness to pay of $2,000-$3,000 per megalitre.

The Queensland Government and Sunwater instead invested $28 million in the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme Efficiency Improvement Project, which exceeded expectations by saving 11,500 megalitres annually and is expected to deliver more than $20 million per year in increased agricultural production for the Tablelands. This efficiency-first approach contrasts with the supply-side focus of the proposed dam construction.
