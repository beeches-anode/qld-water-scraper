## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Urannah Water Scheme is an ambitious $2.9 billion integrated infrastructure project proposed for North Queensland. The project comprises three major components: a 1,500 GL dam on the Broken River, a 22,500 hectare master-planned high-value agricultural irrigation precinct, and a 1.5 GW pumped hydro-electric renewable energy facility.

The project was developed by Bowen River Utilities, a privately-led infrastructure company, working in partnership with Bowen Collinsville Enterprise, a group of local business leaders and community advocates. The proponent's vision is to create next-generation utilities infrastructure that enables Queensland communities to prosper through sustainable water and energy supply.

The project was proposed to address water supply constraints limiting agricultural and industrial development in the Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region. According to preliminary business case analysis, over one-third of the water from the proposed dam would supply current and expanded coal mining operations in the Bowen Basin, with the remainder supporting high-value agricultural development.

The project gained significant government support between 2019-2022, receiving $22.65 million in federal funding for business case development and approvals processes, and being declared a coordinated project by the Queensland Coordinator-General in 2020. However, as of July 2024, the project is listed as "discontinued or on hold," suggesting that development has stalled despite the substantial planning work completed.

### Project History and Status

#### Initial Conception and Feasibility (2017-2019)

The Urannah Dam concept emerged from regional development planning in the Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region, driven by identified water supply constraints for both agricultural expansion and mining industry growth. Bowen Collinsville Enterprise initially championed the project as a catalyst for regional economic development.

Preliminary planning and feasibility work was conducted in the late 2010s, culminating in a preliminary business case completed in 2019. This initial analysis identified the potential for a large-scale integrated project combining water storage, irrigation development, and renewable energy generation.

#### Business Case Development (2019-2021)

In December 2019, the Australian Government announced $10 million in funding from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund to support development of a detailed business case. Natural Resources Minister Anthony Lynham confirmed the funding would go to Bowen Collinsville Enterprise for assessment of what was described as a 1.6 million megalitre dam project.

Bowen River Utilities was established as the formal project proponent, operating through its subsidiary company Urannah Water Scheme. The company is privately owned and led by John Cotter Jr. (through Initiative Capital), who serves as sole director. The business structure positioned the project as a private-public partnership, with the proponent seeking 50% of construction costs from government sources and 50% from private market financing.

The detailed business case was completed in June 2021, presenting economic analysis that projected $4.1 billion in cumulative regional economic impact for the Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region and $13 billion in Queensland-wide benefits. Employment projections indicated 650 full-time equivalent jobs during construction and an average of 160 FTE positions annually during operation, totaling 4,920 jobs over a projected 30-year operational period.

In July 2021, the Australian Government committed an additional $12.65 million toward the business case and approvals work, bringing total federal funding to $22.65 million. This funding supported geotechnical studies, planning work, and the environmental impact assessment process.

#### Coordinated Project Declaration and Environmental Assessment (2020-2022)

In 2020, Queensland's Coordinator-General declared the proposed Urannah Project to be a coordinated project, requiring comprehensive impact assessment to determine significant environmental, social, cultural, and economic effects. This declaration triggered the formal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process.

Draft Terms of Reference for the EIS were published for public consultation from November 30, 2020, through January 29, 2021. The scope of the EIS encompassed the full range of project components: the dam structure, water distribution infrastructure, irrigation precinct, and pumped hydro facility.

Bowen River Utilities engaged consultants BDO and Victoria University to prepare the comprehensive EIS. The assessment involved more than two years of field surveys and technical studies, along with several years of community consultation. The completed EIS was submitted to the Office of the Coordinator-General in 2022.

#### Current Status - Project On Hold (2024)

As of July 2024, the Queensland State Development website lists the Urannah Project under "Projects discontinued or on hold." This represents a significant change from the project's active development status in 2020-2022.

No final approval has been granted by the Coordinator-General, and no construction timeline has been established. The transition to "on hold" status suggests that despite the substantial investment in business case development and environmental assessment, critical barriers to project advancement remain unresolved.

Potential factors contributing to the project's stalled status may include:
- Unresolved Traditional Owner opposition and cultural heritage concerns
- Environmental impact concerns requiring further mitigation
- Inability to secure construction financing
- Changes in political support or government priorities
- Water allocation policy considerations, particularly regarding mining vs. agricultural use

### Environmental Considerations

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

The project underwent a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement process as required for coordinated project status. The EIS, prepared by BDO and Victoria University, involved more than two years of field surveys and technical studies. The assessment examined impacts across the full scope of the integrated project: dam construction and operation, water distribution infrastructure, irrigation development, and pumped hydro facility.

Key findings from the EIS process have not been publicly released in detail, but the assessment addressed ecosystem impacts, water quality, threatened species, downstream effects, and cumulative impacts on the Burdekin catchment and Great Barrier Reef.

#### Ecosystem Impacts

The proposed 1,500 GL dam on the Broken River would fundamentally alter the natural flow regime of the river system. The upper Broken River Valley provides habitat for various flora and fauna species, with inundation of the valley affecting terrestrial and riparian ecosystems across the storage area.

Changes to river flow patterns downstream would affect aquatic ecosystems adapted to natural seasonal variability. The scale of water extraction (1,500 GL storage capacity) represents a significant modification to the Burdekin catchment hydrology.

#### Water Quality

Dam construction and operation typically affect water quality through altered sediment dynamics, thermal stratification, and nutrient cycling. The Broken River contributes to the Burdekin River system, which ultimately discharges to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Changes in sediment loads, nutrient concentrations, and flow patterns could have cascading effects on downstream water quality.

The proposed large-scale irrigation development (22,500 hectares) raises concerns about agricultural runoff, including nutrients, pesticides, and sediments entering waterways. Modern irrigation management practices would be required to minimize these impacts.

#### Downstream Effects

The Burdekin catchment is one of the largest contributors of freshwater flow to the Great Barrier Reef. Significant water extraction through the Urannah scheme could reduce flow volumes reaching the reef system, with potential consequences for reef ecosystem health, salinity gradients, and nutrient dynamics in coastal waters.

Downstream water users and ecosystems dependent on Broken River and Burdekin River flows would be affected by altered flow regimes. The environmental flow requirements to sustain downstream ecosystem values represent a key consideration in project assessment.

#### Mitigation Strategies

The EIS process required identification of environmental protection measures and management strategies. Typical mitigation approaches for dam projects include:
- Environmental flow releases to maintain downstream ecosystem values
- Water quality monitoring and management programs
- Offset measures for habitat loss
- Erosion and sediment control during construction
- Best practice irrigation management to minimize runoff impacts

Specific mitigation commitments for the Urannah Project have not been publicly detailed in available documentation.

#### Environmental Benefits

Proponents identify the 1.5 GW+ pumped hydro-electric facility as delivering environmental benefits through renewable energy generation and grid storage capacity. Pumped hydro can support integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (solar, wind) by providing dispatchable storage.

The modern irrigation infrastructure is promoted as enabling more efficient water use compared to traditional irrigation methods, though this depends on operational practices and management.

#### Ongoing Monitoring

As a coordinated project, approval would require comprehensive environmental monitoring and compliance programs. These would typically include water quality monitoring, ecosystem health assessments, threatened species monitoring, and reporting requirements to regulatory authorities.

### First Nations and Cultural Heritage

#### Traditional Owner Groups

The Urannah project area is the homeland of the Wiri and Birri peoples of the Birri Gubba Nation. In 1998, the Birri Gubba people purchased the Urannah property through the Indigenous Land Council, establishing formal land ownership.

The Traditional Owners identify as river people with profound spiritual connections to the land and waterways. In their own words: "We are the river people our river is sacred it is our life it gives us the connection to our land and the beginning of creation." The word "Birri" means "river" in their traditional language, emphasizing the centrality of the watercourse to cultural identity.

#### Cultural Heritage Assessment

The project area contains Aboriginal sacred sites, including burial sites and ceremonial sites of significant cultural importance. These sites are recognized as protected cultural heritage under Queensland and Commonwealth legislation.

The coordinated project process requires comprehensive cultural heritage assessment and consultation with Traditional Owners. The scope and findings of cultural heritage assessments conducted for the Urannah Project have not been publicly released in detail.

#### Cultural Heritage Concerns

The Birri Gubba Nation has expressed significant opposition to the proposed dam development, citing threats to cultural heritage and spiritual values. Traditional Owners emphasize their duty to protect the Biri (river) against development pressures.

Key concerns raised by Traditional Owners include:
- Inundation and destruction of sacred sites including burial and ceremonial sites
- Loss of connection to country and inability to practice cultural obligations
- Fundamental conflict between damming the sacred river and cultural values
- Water allocation to mining industry conflicting with care for country
- Inadequate consultation and recognition of Traditional Owner rights

The Traditional Owners operate a website (urannah.org) advocating against the dam project and educating the public about cultural values at risk.

#### Protection Measures

The coordinated project approval process requires cultural heritage management planning and Traditional Owner consultation. Standard protection measures for projects affecting cultural heritage include:
- Cultural heritage surveys and assessments
- Site avoidance where possible
- Salvage and documentation of sites that cannot be avoided
- Cultural heritage management plans developed with Traditional Owner input
- Ongoing consultation and engagement frameworks

However, Traditional Owners contend that the fundamental nature of the project—damming their sacred river and inundating significant sites—cannot be adequately mitigated through standard heritage management approaches.

#### Agreements

No Indigenous Land Use Agreement or cultural heritage management agreement has been publicly reported for the Urannah Project. The absence of such agreements, combined with ongoing Traditional Owner opposition, represents a significant barrier to project advancement.

#### Ongoing Relationship

The relationship between the project proponent and Traditional Owners appears adversarial rather than collaborative. Traditional Owners have established public advocacy efforts opposing the project, while the proponent has pursued government approvals through formal regulatory processes.

The project's current "on hold" status may partly reflect the unresolved nature of Traditional Owner opposition and cultural heritage concerns. Major infrastructure projects in Australia increasingly require demonstrated Traditional Owner support or agreement, and the absence of this support creates substantial project risk.

### Approvals and Regulatory Requirements

- Environmental flow release requirements
- Water quality monitoring and management
- Cultural heritage protection measures
- Construction environmental management plans
- Ongoing compliance monitoring and reporting

#### Compliance Requirements

Under coordinated project approval, the proponent would face ongoing compliance obligations including environmental monitoring, reporting to regulatory agencies, implementation of management plans, and compliance auditing. However, with the project on hold, these requirements have not been triggered.

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The Urannah Project is located within the Burdekin River catchment, one of Queensland's most significant water resource areas. The Burdekin supports extensive agricultural development, mining industry water use, and ecological values including contributions to Great Barrier Reef health.

The proposed 1,500 GL storage represents a substantial new water allocation within the catchment. Integration with existing water planning frameworks, allocation mechanisms, and environmental flow requirements would require significant policy work and potentially amendments to water resource plans.

The project's water allocation strategy—with over one-third designated for coal mining operations in the Bowen Basin—sits within broader debates about water use priorities, agricultural versus mining water demands, and sustainable water resource management.

#### Regional Development

The project is positioned as a catalyst for economic transformation in the Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region. Proponents emphasize:
- Enabling 22,500 hectares of high-value agricultural development
- Supporting mining industry growth through reliable water supply
- Creating construction and operational employment
- Diversifying the regional economy through agricultural intensification
- Providing renewable energy infrastructure through pumped hydro

Regional development advocates, including Bowen Collinsville Enterprise and local business leaders, have championed the project as essential infrastructure for unlocking the region's economic potential.

#### Water Security

Proponents argue the project enhances regional water security by providing reliable supply for agricultural and industrial users. The large storage capacity (1,500 GL) would buffer against drought variability and enable water-dependent industries to operate with greater certainty.

However, water security benefits must be weighed against environmental flow requirements, downstream user impacts, and questions about optimal water allocation priorities within the catchment.

#### Stakeholder Support

Stakeholder positions on the project divide significantly:

**Supporters:**
- Regional business community (Bowen Collinsville Enterprise)
- Agricultural development advocates
- Mining industry water users
- Construction and engineering sectors
- Some local government representatives

**Opponents:**
- Birri Gubba Nation Traditional Owners
- Environmental conservation groups
- Great Barrier Reef protection advocates
- Downstream environmental flow advocates

**Mixed or Conditional Support:**
- Agricultural users concerned about water allocation to mining
- Community members weighing economic benefits against environmental and cultural costs

#### Regional Benefits

Claimed regional benefits include:
- $4.1 billion cumulative economic impact for Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region
- Up to 1,200 construction jobs
- 600 ongoing operational jobs
- Enhanced agricultural productivity and export capacity
- Reliable water supply for mining operations
- Renewable energy generation and storage capacity
- Infrastructure development supporting regional growth

#### Integration with Other Projects

The Urannah Project relates to broader water infrastructure and regional development initiatives:
- Part of North Queensland water supply planning discussions
- Complements (or competes with) other proposed water infrastructure developments in the region
- Integrates with renewable energy strategies through pumped hydro component
- Connects to agricultural development planning in the Whitsunday-Isaac area
- Supports (controversially) Bowen Basin coal mining industry water requirements

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

The Urannah Project provides important lessons for water infrastructure development in contemporary Australia:

1. **Traditional Owner Engagement:** The project demonstrates that early, meaningful engagement with Traditional Owners is essential, not optional. Proceeding without Traditional Owner support creates fundamental project risk that cannot be overcome through technical studies alone.

2. **Integrated Assessment:** The integrated project design (water, irrigation, renewable energy) offers efficiency benefits but also creates complexity in impact assessment and approval processes.

3. **Water Allocation Priorities:** The allocation of substantial water to coal mining (>33%) in an era of climate change and Great Barrier Reef concerns creates political and social challenges that affect project viability.

4. **Business Case Limitations:** Substantial investment in business case development ($22.65 million) does not guarantee project advancement. Non-financial factors including cultural heritage, environmental values, and political support are equally or more critical.

5. **Private-Public Partnerships:** The private proponent model with public funding support faces challenges when controversial impacts emerge, as political support can shift and public funding can be withdrawn.

#### Best Practices

Elements of the project approach that represent good practice:
- Comprehensive environmental impact assessment with extended field studies
- Economic analysis providing regional and state-wide benefit assessment
- Integrated project design capturing multiple value streams
- Engagement of professional consultants for technical assessments
- Public consultation processes on Terms of Reference

#### Challenges

Significant challenges encountered include:
- Inability to resolve Traditional Owner opposition and cultural heritage concerns
- Controversy over water allocation to mining versus agricultural or environmental uses
- Potential Great Barrier Reef impacts creating environmental approval challenges
- Changes in political support and government priorities between project phases
- Securing construction financing in a context of unresolved approvals
- Balancing regional economic development aspirations with environmental and cultural protection

#### Legacy

As of 2024, the project's legacy is one of incomplete development—substantial planning and assessment work conducted, but project advancement stalled before final approvals and construction. This outcome reflects:

1. The growing importance of Traditional Owner consent in major development approvals
2. The difficulty of advancing large dam projects in catchments affecting the Great Barrier Reef
3. Changing political and social acceptance of water allocation to fossil fuel industries
4. The high cost and risk of private proponent-led major infrastructure without resolved stakeholder support

The project may influence future approaches to water infrastructure development in Queensland, highlighting the need for:
- Earlier and more comprehensive Traditional Owner engagement
- Clearer water allocation policy frameworks addressing mining versus agricultural use
- Integrated assessment of cumulative catchment impacts
- Realistic assessment of social license alongside technical and economic feasibility

#### Comparable Projects

The Urannah Project can be compared to other Queensland water infrastructure proposals:
- **Hells Gates Dam:** Another major proposed dam in North Queensland with similar regional development objectives and Traditional Owner concerns
- **Burdekin Falls Dam:** The largest water storage in Queensland, providing context for scale and impact
- **Nathan Dam (abandoned):** Proposed Dawson River dam ultimately abandoned after extended controversy, providing cautionary precedent
- **Rookwood Weir (constructed):** Smaller Fitzroy catchment project that navigated approval processes to completion

#### Future Implications

The Urannah Project's trajectory suggests that future water infrastructure development in Queensland will require:
- Demonstrated Traditional Owner support or co-design arrangements
- Clear alignment with environmental protection policies, particularly for Great Barrier Reef catchments
- Transparent water allocation frameworks with broad stakeholder support
- Realistic assessment of social license alongside technical feasibility
- Alternative financing and delivery models that can withstand political shifts

The project's "on hold" status as of 2024 may be temporary or permanent. Revival would likely require:
- Resolution of Traditional Owner concerns through negotiated agreements
- Modified project design addressing environmental impact concerns
- Clearer water allocation policy supporting project rationale
- Renewed government financial support and political commitment
- Demonstrated social license from broader stakeholder community

Whether the Urannah Water Scheme ultimately proceeds, is modified significantly, or is permanently abandoned, the project experience will inform Queensland water infrastructure planning for years to come.
