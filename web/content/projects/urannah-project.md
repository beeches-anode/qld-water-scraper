## Project Overview

The Urannah Water Scheme is a $2.9 billion integrated infrastructure project proposed for North Queensland, comprising three major components: a 1,500 GL dam on the Broken River, a 22,500 hectare high-value agricultural irrigation precinct, and a 1.5 GW pumped hydro-electric renewable energy facility.

The project was developed by Bowen River Utilities, a privately-led infrastructure company working in partnership with Bowen Collinsville Enterprise. According to preliminary business case analysis, over one-third of the water from the proposed dam would supply current and expanded coal mining operations in the Bowen Basin, with the remainder supporting high-value agricultural development.

As of July 2024, the Queensland State Development website lists the project under "Projects discontinued or on hold," indicating that despite substantial planning work, the project has stalled before final approvals.

## Project History

The Urannah Dam concept emerged from regional development planning in the Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region, driven by identified water supply constraints for both agricultural expansion and mining industry growth. Bowen Collinsville Enterprise initially championed the project as a catalyst for regional economic development.

In December 2019, the Australian Government announced $10 million in funding from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund to support development of a detailed business case. The business case was completed in June 2021, presenting economic analysis projecting $4.1 billion in cumulative regional economic impact. In July 2021, an additional $12.65 million in federal funding was committed.

In 2020, Queensland's Coordinator-General declared the proposed Urannah Project to be a coordinated project, triggering the formal Environmental Impact Statement process. Draft Terms of Reference for the EIS were published for public consultation from November 2020 through January 2021. The completed EIS, prepared by BDO and Victoria University after more than two years of field surveys, was submitted in 2022.

No final approval has been granted by the Coordinator-General. The transition to "on hold" status in July 2024 suggests that critical barriers to project advancement remain unresolved.

## Environmental Considerations

The proposed 1,500 GL dam on the Broken River would fundamentally alter the natural flow regime of the river system. The upper Broken River Valley provides habitat for various flora and fauna species, and inundation would affect terrestrial and riparian ecosystems across the storage area.

The Burdekin catchment is one of the largest contributors of freshwater flow to the Great Barrier Reef. Significant water extraction through the Urannah scheme could reduce flow volumes reaching the reef system, with potential consequences for reef ecosystem health. The proposed large-scale irrigation development raises concerns about agricultural runoff entering waterways that ultimately discharge to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.

The project underwent comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement assessment examining ecosystem impacts, water quality, threatened species, downstream effects, and cumulative impacts on the Burdekin catchment and Great Barrier Reef. The 1.5 GW pumped hydro-electric facility is promoted by proponents as delivering environmental benefits through renewable energy generation and grid storage capacity.

## Cultural Heritage

The Urannah project area is the homeland of the Wiri and Birri peoples of the Birri Gubba Nation. In 1998, the Birri Gubba people purchased the Urannah property through the Indigenous Land Council. The Traditional Owners identify as river people with profound spiritual connections to the land and waterways. In their own words: "We are the river people our river is sacred it is our life it gives us the connection to our land and the beginning of creation." The word "Birri" means "river" in their traditional language.

The project area contains Aboriginal sacred sites, including burial sites and ceremonial sites of significant cultural importance. The Birri Gubba Nation has expressed significant opposition to the proposed dam development, citing threats to cultural heritage and spiritual values. Key concerns include inundation and destruction of sacred sites, loss of connection to country, and water allocation to mining industry conflicting with care for country.

The Traditional Owners operate a website (urannah.org) advocating against the dam project and educating the public about cultural values at risk. No Indigenous Land Use Agreement or cultural heritage management agreement has been publicly reported for the project.

## Regional Context

The Urannah Project is positioned as a catalyst for economic transformation in the Mackay-Whitsunday-Isaac region, enabling agricultural development and supporting mining industry growth through reliable water supply. Regional development advocates, including Bowen Collinsville Enterprise and local business leaders, have championed the project as essential infrastructure.

The project has significant stakeholder division: regional business community, agricultural advocates, and mining industry support the project, while Birri Gubba Nation Traditional Owners, environmental conservation groups, and Great Barrier Reef protection advocates oppose it. The water allocation strategy, with over one-third designated for coal mining operations, has generated particular controversy regarding water use priorities.

The proposed funding model sought 50% of construction costs from government sources and 50% from private market financing. Construction funding has not been secured.
