## Project Overview

The Warwick to Stanthorpe Pipeline is a proposed water infrastructure project that would construct approximately 40 kilometres of pipeline connecting Stanthorpe's water treatment system to Warwick's water supply network. The pipeline would run from the Mount Marlay Water Treatment Plant in Stanthorpe to Connolly Dam, which is connected to Leslie Dam, Warwick's main water source.

The project was proposed as a drought resilience measure following the severe water crisis of 2019-2020, when Storm King Dam reached critically low levels. The project is being assessed as part of the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment, jointly funded by the Australian and Queensland governments through the National Water Grid Fund.

The draft Regional Water Assessment identifies the Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline as the only option investigated that fully addresses Stanthorpe's urban water security risk during drought conditions.

## Project History

### Drought Crisis (2019-2020)

The impetus for this pipeline arose from severe drought in the Southern Downs region. Storm King Dam, Stanthorpe's primary water source, reached critically low levels by September 2019. From that time until April 2021, water had to be trucked daily from Connolly Dam near Warwick to maintain the town's water supply—an arrangement lasting approximately 18 months.

During this period, water was transported to two 1-megalitre tanks that gravity-fed water into the raw water line at Storm King Dam. This emergency response highlighted Stanthorpe's vulnerability and the de facto connection to Warwick's water system through trucking.

### Infrastructure Improvements (2019-2020)

During and shortly after the drought crisis, a $6.56 million pipeline was constructed from Storm King Dam to the Mount Marlay Water Treatment Plant in Stanthorpe, replacing a 60-year-old pipeline. This project consisted of almost nine kilometres of new pipeline and was partly funded with a $3.94 million contribution from the Queensland Government through the 2017-19 Local Government Grants and Subsidies Program.

### Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023)

The Queensland Government commissioned the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment to evaluate water security options for the region, examining multiple infrastructure proposals including the Warwick to Stanthorpe Pipeline and the Granite Belt Irrigation Project (Emu Swamp Dam).

The draft Regional Water Assessment was released for public consultation in November 2023, with on-ground sessions held in Toowoomba, Chinchilla, Goondiwindi, Stanthorpe, and Warwick. The assessment recommended commencing a Detailed Business Case for the Warwick to Stanthorpe Pipeline, subject to outcomes of the Granite Belt Irrigation Project.

### Current Status

As of late 2024, no detailed business case has commenced. The project's progression is explicitly tied to resolution of the Granite Belt Irrigation Project, which has experienced significant challenges with costs escalating from an original estimate of $84 million to over $240 million, leading to funding deferral while alternative options are assessed.

## Regional Context

The Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline is separate from the Toowoomba to Warwick Pipeline, which received over $300 million in Queensland Government funding in June 2022. That 111-kilometre pipeline, being delivered by Seqwater with construction expected between 2025 and 2027, will provide permanent water supply to Toowoomba communities and serve as drought contingency for the Southern Downs region. However, it does not provide a direct piped connection to Stanthorpe—water would still need to be carted from Warwick during severe drought.

The project sits within the Border Rivers catchment and would integrate with existing infrastructure including Storm King Dam (Stanthorpe), Leslie Dam, and Connolly Dam (Warwick water supply system).

Local media coverage characterised the pipeline as "a lifeline" for Stanthorpe, reflecting community interest in improved water security following the severe drought experience.
