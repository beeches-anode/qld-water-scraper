## Detailed Information Section

### Project Overview

The Warwick to Stanthorpe Pipeline is a proposed water infrastructure project that would construct approximately 40 kilometres of pipeline connecting Stanthorpe's water treatment system to Warwick's water supply network. The pipeline would run from the Mount Marlay Water Treatment Plant in Stanthorpe to Connolly Dam, which is connected to Leslie Dam, Warwick's main water source.

The project was proposed as a drought resilience measure for Stanthorpe following the severe water crisis of 2019-2020, when Storm King Dam (Stanthorpe's primary water source) reached critically low levels. Between September 2019 and April 2021, water had to be trucked daily from Connolly Dam near Warwick to Stanthorpe for approximately 18 months to maintain the town's water supply.

The project is being assessed as part of the Queensland Government's Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment, which is jointly funded by the Australian and Queensland governments through the National Water Grid Fund. The assessment examines multiple water security options for the region, including Stanthorpe, Toowoomba, Warwick, Southern Downs, Goondiwindi, and parts of the Western Downs.

According to the advocacy group Protect Our Water's interpretation of the draft Regional Water Assessment, the Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline is the only option investigated that fully addresses Stanthorpe's urban water security risk during drought conditions.

### Key Specifications

- **Capacity/Scale:** Specific capacity not publicly specified; designed to provide urban water supply security for Stanthorpe
- **Infrastructure Components:**
  - Approximately 40 kilometres of pipeline
  - Connection from Mount Marlay Water Treatment Plant in Stanthorpe
  - Connection to Connolly Dam (linked to Leslie Dam system near Warwick)
- **Design Features:** Not specified (detailed design not yet completed)
- **Operational Parameters:** Pipeline would provide water from Warwick's water supply system to Stanthorpe during periods when Storm King Dam levels are insufficient

### Project History and Status

#### Drought Crisis (2019-2020)

The impetus for the Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline arose from the severe drought experienced in the Southern Downs region between 2019 and 2020. Storm King Dam, Stanthorpe's primary water source, reached critically low levels, with water levels becoming critically low by September 2019. From that time until April 2021, water had to be trucked daily from Connolly Dam near Warwick to Stanthorpe to maintain the town's water supply—an arrangement that continued for approximately 18 months.

During this period, water was transported to two 1-megalitre tanks that gravity-fed water into the raw water line at the wall of Storm King Dam. This emergency response highlighted the vulnerability of Stanthorpe's water supply during severe drought and the de facto connection to Warwick's water system through water carting.

#### Infrastructure Improvements (2019-2020)

During and shortly after the drought crisis, several water infrastructure improvements were made:

- A $6.56 million pipeline was constructed from Storm King Dam to the Mount Marlay Water Treatment Plant in Stanthorpe, replacing a 60-year-old pipeline. This project consisted of almost nine kilometres of new pipeline and was partly funded with a $3.94 million contribution from the Queensland Government through the 2017-19 Local Government Grants and Subsidies Program. The project was completed and delivered by Southern Downs Regional Council.

#### Regional Water Assessment (2021-2023)

The Queensland Government commissioned the Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment to evaluate water security options for the region. This assessment examined multiple infrastructure proposals, including:

- Emu Swamp Dam and Pipeline (Granite Belt Irrigation Project)
- Warwick to Stanthorpe Pipeline
- Glebe Weir Offstream Storage and pipeline augmentation
- Various other water security options

The draft Regional Water Assessment was released for public consultation in November 2023.

#### Public Consultation (November-December 2023)

Public consultation on the Regional Water Assessment ran from November 16 to December 14, 2023. On-ground consultation sessions were held in Toowoomba, Chinchilla, Goondiwindi, Stanthorpe, and Warwick.

The assessment recommended commencing a Detailed Business Case for the Warwick to Stanthorpe Pipeline, subject to outcomes of the project development work for the Granite Belt Irrigation Project (Emu Swamp Dam).

#### Current Status (2024-2025)

As of November 2024, no detailed business case has been commenced for the Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline. The project's progression is explicitly tied to the resolution of the Granite Belt Irrigation Project.

The Granite Belt Irrigation Project, which involves a 12,000-megalitre dam at Emu Swamp and approximately 120 kilometres of pipeline, has experienced significant challenges. Originally estimated at $84 million, the project cost increased to over $240 million, leading to deferral of funding while alternative water security options are assessed. The project received $23.4 million from local irrigators, $47 million from the Australian Government, and a conditional commitment of $13.6 million from the Queensland Government, but funding has been deferred pending the outcomes of the Regional Water Assessment.

### Regional Context

#### Water Plan Integration

The Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline is being assessed within the broader Southern and Darling Downs Regional Water Assessment framework, which covers the Toowoomba, Southern Downs, and Goondiwindi regional council areas and extends across parts of the Western Downs Regional Council, including Dalby and Chinchilla.

The project sits within the Border Rivers catchment area and would integrate with existing water infrastructure including Storm King Dam (Stanthorpe), Leslie Dam, and Connolly Dam (Warwick water supply system).

#### Regional Development

The Southern Downs region has a diverse economy including agriculture (particularly on the Granite Belt), tourism, and rural services. Water security is essential for economic stability and growth in the region.

#### Water Security

Stanthorpe's water security challenges were dramatically highlighted during the 2019-2020 drought when the town came close to running out of water entirely. The town's population and businesses relied on daily water trucking from Warwick for approximately 18 months.

The Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline is described in the Regional Water Assessment as the only option that fully addresses Stanthorpe's urban water security risk, according to stakeholder interpretations of the assessment.

#### Stakeholder Support

Local media coverage suggests community support for improved water security infrastructure following the severe drought experience. The project has been characterized as "a lifeline" for Stanthorpe.

However, the project's progression is contingent on resolution of the Granite Belt Irrigation Project (Emu Swamp Dam), which has faced opposition from environmental groups including Protect Our Water, concerns about cost escalation, and questions about its economic viability.

#### Regional Benefits

The primary regional benefit would be drought-proofing Stanthorpe's urban water supply, eliminating the need for costly and logistically complex emergency water trucking during severe drought.

#### Integration with Other Projects

The Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline is explicitly linked to the Granite Belt Irrigation Project in the Regional Water Assessment, with its detailed business case development contingent on outcomes of that project's development work.

The project is separate from the Toowoomba to Warwick Pipeline, a different infrastructure project that received over $300 million in Queensland Government funding in June 2022. That pipeline, being delivered by Seqwater, is approximately 111 kilometres long, with construction due to commence in 2025 and expected completion in March 2027. The Toowoomba to Warwick Pipeline will provide permanent water supply to several Toowoomba communities and serve as a drought contingency supply for the Southern Downs region, though water would be carted to Stanthorpe from Warwick during severe drought rather than piped directly.

### Lessons and Legacy

#### Key Lessons

The Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline proposal demonstrates several important lessons about water infrastructure planning in regional Queensland:

1. **Drought Vulnerability:** The severe 2019-2020 drought exposed the vulnerability of communities reliant on single water sources, particularly smaller storages susceptible to climate variability

2. **Emergency Response Costs:** The 18-month period of daily water trucking from Warwick to Stanthorpe demonstrated that emergency responses to water shortages are costly, logistically complex, and unsustainable as long-term solutions

3. **Interconnected Systems:** The drought response effectively created a temporary connection between the Warwick and Stanthorpe water systems through trucking, demonstrating the value of permanent interconnection

4. **Project Interdependencies:** The linking of the Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline business case to the outcomes of the Granite Belt Irrigation Project illustrates how regional water planning often involves complex interdependencies between multiple infrastructure proposals

5. **Cost Uncertainty:** The experience of the Granite Belt Irrigation Project, with costs escalating from $84 million to over $240 million, highlights the challenges of cost estimation for water infrastructure in regional areas

#### Challenges

- **Funding Uncertainty:** Without a detailed business case, project costs and funding pathways remain undefined
- **Conditional Progression:** The project's advancement is tied to resolution of the separate Granite Belt Irrigation Project, creating uncertainty about timeline and feasibility
- **Competing Priorities:** Regional water planning involves balancing urban water security (Stanthorpe), irrigation development (Granite Belt), and broader regional water needs across multiple council areas
- **Climate Change:** Increasing climate variability and drought severity may affect project assumptions and requirements

#### Legacy

The project, if implemented, would represent a permanent solution to Stanthorpe's drought vulnerability, replacing the emergency water trucking arrangement with reliable pipeline infrastructure. However, as of November 2024, the project remains in the early planning stage without committed funding or a clear pathway to construction.

#### Comparable Projects

The Toowoomba to Warwick Pipeline provides a comparable example of inter-regional water supply infrastructure in the Southern Downs area, with over $300 million in funding and construction expected between 2025 and 2027. However, that project does not provide a direct piped connection to Stanthorpe, relying instead on water carting during drought.

#### Future Implications

The progression (or non-progression) of the Warwick to Stanthorpe pipeline will have implications for:

- How Queensland addresses urban water security in small regional communities
- The role of permanent infrastructure versus emergency response measures
- Integration of urban water security with irrigation and agricultural water infrastructure planning
- The use of Regional Water Assessments as a planning framework for water infrastructure

The project's conditional status highlights ongoing policy questions about prioritization of urban water security versus agricultural water development in regional water planning.
